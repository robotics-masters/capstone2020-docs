# Meeting Minutes 21/09/2020 #

Main goals for this week:

* Integrate tensorflow sign classifier as a donkeycar part
* Perform action in response to turn sign / stop sign detection

Notes:

* You can change the resolution of the donkey car camera stream (change the height and width to increase the resolution, e.g. 224 x 224 seems to be a good compromise).
* Retain repository structure and copy-paste
