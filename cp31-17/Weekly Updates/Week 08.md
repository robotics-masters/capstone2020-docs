| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | Implementation of customizable camera resolution in the simulator.  | N/A |
| Time | Project scheduled to finish on time. | N/A |
| Quality | Overall quality of project and its deliverables | N/A |
| Planned activities | Improve detection for weaker signs. Progress on F1 maps. Implement custom camera resolution from configuration file.  | Work on F1 maps and work on appropriate response to sign detections with the newly implemented brake and speed values. |
| Achievements | Break and speed values from car now obtainable. Camera configuration is now customisable from configuration file. Improved park and turn response. Elevation for F1 maps. Documentation for adding custom car models.  | N/A |
| Major deliverables | None | Final report to be worked on. |
| Major issues | Limitations of Unity's lighting has been hard to accurately detect traffic lights. |Bugs with porting everyone to Donkey 4.0 and implementation of brake for team. |
| Major risks |Reminders for meetings and other scheduled tasks has been addressed with the implementation of a calendar bot to post reminders. | Possible conflicts in code when merging branches to master. |
| External dependencies | Assignments for other units due for some of group.| Assignments for other units due for some of group.|
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual  | 4 group + 8 individual |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 3 group + 7 individual | N/A |
| Overall Status (Red/Yellow/Green)| Yellow| N/A |
