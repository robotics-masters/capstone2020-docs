\* - The Manager and Customer roles have been rotated in the first few weeks. However, we have decided to have fixed roles for Manager and Customer as recommended by the tutor and due to the fact that the roles are difficult to transfer on a weekly basis.

In addition to the roles, we have the following git and BitBucket experts: Zhiyi and Boswell. The roles have been chosen as they have past experience and familiarity with git and BitBucket.

With respect to the software stack we have designed, below are roles:

- Neural Networks Design and Training: Martin, Gio, Steven

- Gazebo Simulator/Ardupilot Environment: Zhiyi, Boswell

- Traffic Light Controller: Zhiyi

- Modelling and Simulator World: Zhiyi, Boswell

- Integration: Yexin
