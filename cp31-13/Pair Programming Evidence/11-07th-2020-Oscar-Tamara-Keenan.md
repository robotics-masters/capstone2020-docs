Oscar was using a while loop that did not seem to change anything from iteration to iteration, yet he was only getting the desired output after the first loop. At first, it was just Oscar and Tamara, but Keenan joined after a while to help resolve the issue. 

In the end, Oscar left it as it was because the updated version created for the simulator had no need for a while loop, and didn't have that issue.
