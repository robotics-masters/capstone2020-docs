Individual report for Boswell Lin, due Sunday 4th October.

### XP Roles
* Programmer (Wk2) - this role initially did not involve any coding as we were still in the stage of establishing contact with client, getting client specifications, and figuring out the system architecture. I spent most of this time setting up the system and writing documentation for everyone else in the team as well as the client for set up. Created and edited [this page](https://bitbucket.org/zson5784/comp3988_t17b_group_5/wiki/docs/Set-Up%20(Ubuntu%2018.04).md)
* Customer (Wk3) - in this role, I spent time working with the client on getting requirements and setting up the required dependencies then distributing the information to the rest of the team

* Manager (Wk4 onwards) - as suggested by the tutor, our group decided to fix the customer and manager role for the rest of the project. This was due to the fact that the responsibilities became harder to transfer on a weekly basis. In this role, I spent time helping create the user stories, tracking issues and generally guiding the direction of the project. In addition to this role, I also picked up work from other roles when team members needed help or were unavailable due to other commitments. 

### Technical Work
#### Week 2 and 3:
* Setting up the environment and testing different dependencies required to design the system.
* Creating the documentation for the rest of the team members on setting up the development environment with the help of Zhiyi. 

#### Week 4:
* Finalised documentation for set up environment - user story: [Set up environment](https://trello.com/c/6atOceQg/18-as-a-developer-i-need-to-setup-a-development-environment)

* Intended to add more traffic signs into the world but I had other commitments (other assignments due this week)

### Other contributions:
* For the traffic light integration code, I worked with Zhiyi on integrating it into the simulator world. We used instant messaging to communicate as well as used Bitbucket for code reviews. PR: [Pull request](https://bitbucket.org/zson5784/comp3988_t17b_group_5/pull-requests/6)
* User stories: Added in user stories for the simulator world:

### Reflection
Although I've had work experience in software development, this is my first time using XP as well as being in the role of a manager. This new experience to me has taught me a lot of skills including time management and collaboration. 

Another challenge for me was that I knew nothing about OpenCV and TensorFlow before coming onto this project. Although I have some knowledge of AI and programming, this was insufficient to make progress. I had to learn new technologies. Furthermore, as this is a relatively new technology field, there are not a lot of online resources for drone simulations. This resulted in our team having to spend more time researching to understand how it worked.

I've also used git as version control for at least 2 years now, so this is something I've been used to. I passed on my knowledge and experience in version control to members on the team who did not have experience. This helped us overcome the issue of collaboration as we managed to work together as a team on different components.

As a manager, I had to learn what everyone was doing and decide how to integrate different components everyone was working on. I also had to write up wikis (linked earlier in this document) to get everyone up to speed and ensure we are making progress.

I believe I could improve by spending more time on writing more documents as well as talking more often to everyone in the team to better understand the current status of the project. We have been behind schedule and this was mostly in due to other commitments of everyone in the team. I should talk with everyone in the team in the future to determine time allocations then better adjust our weekly goals so we are on track.
