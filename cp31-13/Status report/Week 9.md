| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Improve code for remaining traffic signs and integrate into the simulator. Also, create Singapore track. Add testing for the OpenCv algorithms | Portugal track and remaining car. Detection code for turning signs. Continue testing |
| **Time** | Should be good. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | Good so far. Work required on other traffic signs detection improvement. | Still good. Work required on the remaining traffic sign detection code, the tracks and the cars. |
| **Planned Activities** | Finish the testing framework.F1 Tracks | Continue working on tasks assigned - traffic lights, parking signs, turn signs and the tracks. Also improve the action the car takes upon a detection. |
