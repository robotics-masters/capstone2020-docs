* Today, we need to do a technical deployment: need to make sure that the main parts of our work can run successfully on the client's machine
* Final client demo/deployment is on Thursday
* Information regarding content of client demo:
    - We need to follow the structure Cian sent via email
    - Rather than a full deployment, Cian wants this to be more of a high-level showcase of all of our work
    - Showing code is not required, just talk about our high-level structure: capturing drone frames -> feeding into OpenCV to get ROI -> predicting using TensorFlow
    - Need to mention our testing results along with reasons why they might be bad
* Information regarding logistics of client demo:
    - We are scheduled for 5:45 pm, but should come at 4:45 pm for a technical test
    - Presentation is done via screen sharing
    - Presentation can be either pre-recorded or live
        - Most team members prefer to do it live
