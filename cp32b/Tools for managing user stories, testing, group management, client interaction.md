# Technical documentation
Update on 4 Oct 2020

## Manage user story

We use Trello and Jira to manage user stories

**Trello**: [manage user story on Trello](https://trello.com/b/8tvR5Ehi/comp3988t17bgroup1userstory)

**Jira**: [manage user story on Jira](https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/jira?site=be859735-9bb3-4a0d-a5cb-b2a285747fd9&statuses=new&statuses=indeterminate&statuses=done&sort=-updated&page=1)
## Group management

**Bitbucket and Git**
Our team uses Atlassian Bitbucket for the collaboration and documentation of our project. 

**Bitbucket Wiki**
The wiki page of Bitbucket allows us to record and track any documentations we have regarding the project. Our group uses the wiki page to record our meeting minutes with the client and within our group, scope statement, useful links, status reports and our personal weekly update videos, **appendix J** is a snapshot of our homepage.

**Discord**
Discord is our main communication tool for the project, we use Discord to discuss anything related to the project (questions, thoughts, etc) within our group and with the client to ask for any clarifications regarding the deliverables of each week and sometimes for help on the implementation. Discord allows users to create their servers for communication and multiple channels can be used in one server, we are in the server: **Sydney2020** and our team channel for the project is: **cp32-17b1**.

**Slack (not used anymore)**
We initially use Slack for communication amongst our team members, client and tutor, but our client prefers using Discord to communicate due to its convenience of communicating with multiple groups.


## Testing

**Donkey Car simulator**
Using the simulator, we can colloct raw iamges for model training, and also test self-driving Donkey car model.

**TensorFlow**
We use TensorFlow to train and test our image classification model (CNN)

**Jupyter Notebook**
It allows us to store the state of computation such as loading/pre-processing the dataset and trained model (in comparison to python script). This saves a lot of computational times. In addition, it allowed us to present our models/findings among ourselves and to the client more easily. 

**Unity**
We use unity to create map with different kinds of sign, which is used in donkey car simulator.

**Colab**
Google Colab provide cloud computation FREE GPU to accelerate training donkey car model.


## Client interaction 

**Discord**
We interact with client frequently on Discord to ask any related questions and clarifications.
We are in the server: **Sydney2020** and our team channel for the project is: **cp32-17b1**

**Zoom**
We have zoom meeting with client twice per week (one on Monday. and one on Firday, 15 mins each).
