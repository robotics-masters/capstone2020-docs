# Week 5 Weekly Update
| Unit of Study | COMP3888 |
|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | |
| Report date| 21-27/09/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | No major scope changes | N/A |
| Time | No major changes in project planning | N/A |
| Quality | The quality of the project deliverables recently was high with minimal issues integrating code into existing solution | N/A |
| Planned activities | Move over the code base to RMRacer and model new signs | Finish the recording of the demo, presentation and completion of the report |
| Achievements | Made slight improvements to detection code, moved over code base to be able to be run in the simulator, simulator updated with new models and assets that are scaled appropriately  | N/A |
| Major deliverables | Updated simulator and assets with new and properly scaled signs, moved over the detection code base to conform to RMracer | Group report, individual report, demo and presentation|
| Major issues | Issues surrounding integration to simulator, scale of objects in the simulator and executing detection code in the simulator were fixed | Potential issues may occur with respect to changing the detection code in the new code base|
| Major risks | Potential risks associated with poor performance in the demo with regards to sign detection | There are issues of falling behind in development in order to focus on the report  |
| External dependencies |  A significant amount of effort needed to be put into fixing issues in the integration of the simulator| A significant amount of time over the next week will need to be spent on the report, demo and presentation |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 8-9 hours per member  | 8-10 hours per member |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 8 hours per member | N/A |
| Overall Status Red/Yellow/Green| Yellow | N/A |
