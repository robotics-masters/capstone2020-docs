1. Submit a status report.

2. Start working on a way to generate training images with random noisy background and random location and sizes of signs.

1. Submit a status report.

2. Successfully generated 1,000 images of stop and green parking sign with random backgrounds. They have been submitted to examine their effectiveness in training models.

## Week 10 ##

[weekly individual summary video](https://youtu.be/M33l6vhlL0E)

1. Submit a status report.

2. The tutor requires that a continuous integration/development tool must be set up. Start working on integrating such a tool into our project. We decided to use pipeline - built-in CI/CD tool on Bitbucket.

## Week 11 ##

[weekly individual summary video](https://youtu.be/NDRO-ccFWfo)

1. Submit a status report.

2. Pipeline is almost completed. Now we are going to upload test cases that test on the accuracy of the model, written in PyTest, onto the pipeline.

## Week 12 ##

[weekly individual summary video](https://youtu.be/AWeeRJO3CE0)

1. Submit a status report.

2. Initial experiments with pipeline failed because the dependency lists cannot be correctly loaded in pipeline (or local machines). I manually created the requirements file for the project environment.

3. Using the new requirement file, run time environment can be set up correctly on Pipeline. Automatic builds are initiated when there is a push to the repository.

4. Prepare for the demo (to the school).

## Week 13 ##

1. Writing individual/group reports

2. clean up Wiki

3. Complete presentation

4. Project wrap-up.
