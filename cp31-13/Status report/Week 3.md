| **Quick description** | Improving on Algorithms for computer vision without neural networks, using models and tracks in an Unity project. |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Scope is relatively the same, we just want to add a few more enhancements to the simulator now. | |
| **Time** | Should be good. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | Overall quality of the project and its deliverables | |
| **Planned Activities** | Refine the OpenCv code, implement the tracks in the simulator and implement models in the simulator. | Refine the OpenCv code, implement the tracks in the simulator and implement models in the simulator. |
| **Achievements** | Improved understanding of how env\_ids work in the simulator.Improved understanding of OpenCV and various image processing operations. Code modifications led to slightly better results than original code. | |
| **Major deliverables** | The two tracks have been implemented in the simulator, the traffic signs have been modelled in, code for turn signs has been modified to improve results slightly. | Improvements to the simulator and to the OpenCv code. |
| **Major issues** | Jupyter deliverable was confirmedUnity asset management was also confirmed | There arent any more improvements we can make to the OpenCV code so we will chat with the client on what hed like us to work on next. |
| **Major risks** | There has been some difficulties understanding how the simulator works, but hopefully this doesnt become a long-term problem. | N/A |
