Notes:

* Client Deployment
    * We requested the demo be pushed back a week (into Week 13/STUVAC)
    * Client was happy with that. Cian will email out the information to us and the other teams soon.
    * The final demo is more of a "showcase"
        * Won't be as in-depth as the first demo.
        * No code reviews, etc. Just a demo of the features.
        * Have a few slides listing features that have been implemented, but don't talk about them.
        * Only demo a few select features. 

* Track 4 terrain:
    * Cian would like terrain (similar to track 3) to be added to track 4.

* Feature improvements/additions:
    * Cian would like better results on the real-world dataset.
        * He is going to ask another team to label some data for us to re-train
        * @Jarod needs to prepare the documentation to give the other team so they can label data in the correct format for our model
