| **Quick description** | Improving on Algorithms for computer vision without neural networks, using models and tracks in an Unity project. |
| --- | --- |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Prepare project for client deployment.Implement a brake system.Improve OpenCV detection code. | Integrate the traffic sign code into the simulator and ensure the car makes the right decision based on the sign seen. |
| **Time** | Brake system has been added and we've been able to get our own OpenCV code working within the simulator. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | Good so far, though time pressure may affect the quality of our detection and future tracks. | Good so far. Work required on other traffic signs detection improvement. |
| **Planned Activities** | Implement brake systemExperiment with new OpenCv detection techniques. | Change the resolution of the Donkey Car, train a new AI, further refine OpenCVF1 Tracks |
| **Achievements** | Brakes added to donkey car | N/A |
| **Major deliverables** | OpenCV code working in the simulator. | Refine prototype for client. |
| **Major issues** | Some real life detection techniques don't integrate correctly into the simulator.Some attempted OpenCV techniques are not giving results conducive to the project | Refining OpenCV detection code in simulator |
| **Major risks** | N/A | N/A |
| **External dependencies** | N/A | N/A |
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 38 | 28 |
