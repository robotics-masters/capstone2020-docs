1. Download the Unity Sandbox simulator.
2. Copy and paste one of the existing scenes in the simulator, and open this copy pasted scene.
3. Create a 3D object > cube and add this to the scene.
4. Create a new material in Unity, this will act as the texture for the track. Open this material and set the texture to be the track you want to implement.
5. Apply this material onto the 3D object created earlier.
6. Scale the x and z axis of the 3D object. Use the scale of 1 Unity unit = 2.5cm to get your desired length.
7. Create 4 more 3D game objects > cube and position and scale them correctly so that they surround the track as walls.
8. Open the menu scene and copy paste one of the existing buttons. Reposition it to somewhere else on the screen.
