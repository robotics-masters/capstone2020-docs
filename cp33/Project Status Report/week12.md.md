| **Team name** | COMP3988\_T17B\_Group5 |
| **Project Name** | CP33 - Implementing Object Detection (Object Detection for Simulated Drones) |
| **Project start date** | Monday, 24/08/2020 |
| **Project end date** | Friday, 20/11/2020 |
| **Project point person** | Boswell Lin |
| **Report Date** | 20/11/2020 |
| **Quick description** | Using neural networks and/or computer vision to implement object detection for simulated drones. |
| --- | --- |
| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope**| Implement a working sign and obstacle detection algorithm for drones within a simulated environment (Gazebo) ||
| **Time**| Up to date ||
| **Quality** | Up to standard so far ||
| **Planned Activities** |-Finalise our neural network and finalise all testing - Prepare for client deployment | ||
| **Achievements** |-Improved neural network - Unit testing and improved accuracy for neural network | Final client deployment | 
| **Major deliverables** | Testing frameworking - integration testingDetect signs with low accuracy using openCV - Final client deployment -Improved detection of signs with openCV to feed into NN to minimise background noise |  |
| **Major issues** |  - OpenCV finding many false positives however has improved since last week |  |
| **Major risks** | OpenCV still having issues finding bounding boxes for signs particularly the false positive rate |  |
| **External dependencies**| No external dependencies for this week | No external dependencies for next week|
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 15 hours | 15 hours |
| **Recorded effort (h)** | 15 hours ||
| **Overall Status (RYG)** | Green |
