|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | Everyone |
| Report date| 04/10/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | New requirement/milestones where discussed and will given to us next week | Read the new requirement and delegate tasks accordingly |
| Time | We are currently behind on the action component of sign detection | For a few of the OpenCV members to start focusing on action instead of the detection |
| Quality | Client is happy with current quality of project and so are we | N/A |
| Planned activities | Delegate task to members, Implement new car model and actions into simulator and fix up the presentation of the Wiki| N/A |
| Achievements | Finished the group report and demo and we figured out the problem with sign detection in the simulator | N/A |
| Major deliverables | Group report, individual report, demo and presentation | N/A |
| Major issues | It seems that our documentation on the Wiki is average, more documentation would be good | Being unable to figure the actions function in the code|
| Major risks | Falling behind on some aspect of the deliverable | Sign Detection need more monitoring |
| External dependencies | Next week is mid semester break so people might be busy with holidays | N/A |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 6 Group + 9 individual  | 4 hours + 8 individual |
