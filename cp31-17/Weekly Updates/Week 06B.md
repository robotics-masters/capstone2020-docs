|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | Everyone|
| Report date| 11/09/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | New tracks and car models were reviewed and planned.  | N/A |
| Time | Sign detection algorithms behind schedule. Simulator side on schedule | The OpenCV members to focus on implementing action and getting basic detection instead of the refining detection for demo.  |
| Quality | Client is happy with current quality. | N/A |
| Planned activities | Integrate second car model into simulator, basic functioning sign detection and stop response | Work on demo deployment to present on Friday's meeting. Begin implementation of new map into simulator. Improve stop response, work on turn response|
| Achievements | Successfully added second car model into simulator. Car is able to respond to stop sign is detected. Traffic cone test and detection. Alternative turn sign detection.| N/A |
| Major deliverables | N/A | Client Demo|
| Major issues | Documentation on Wiki still needs improvement. DonkeyCar could not be updated for Mac users.| N/A|
| Major risks | Custom test maps were implemented into simulator for further testing on sign detection. | OpenCV algorithms to be monitored in case of falling behind. |
| External dependencies | N/A | Assignments and Exams due for team members in Weeks 7/8 |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 Group + 8 Individual  | 4 Group + 9 Individual |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 6 Group + 6 Individual | N/A |
| Overall Status (Red/Yellow/Green)|Yellow| N/A |
