Notes:

* Deployment
	* Cian needs our two models and the rmracer folder
	* One person to show the simulator and the sign detection working
	* Cian will try to run our code on his own computer (he will try to have both Windows and Ubuntu ready to test on)
	* Three things to be checked:
		* Where we're up to (powerpoint)
		* Live demonstration
		* If Cian can deploy it on his own computer
* Partner team
	* One of the other teams needs someone to deploy their solution for testing
	* We would deploy their voice deepfake network and they will deploy our models
	* See their first demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO8rUCFMSwo)
* Donkeycar 4 seems unstable
	* Cian wants to test our deployment using Donkeycar4
	* We can use donkeycar3 for this deployment and change later
* Training server

	* Use discord channel #brut to coordinate when to use the server
