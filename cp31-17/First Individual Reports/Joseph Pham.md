# Individual Report – Joseph Pham #

## ***Work Done and Extent of Work*** ##
This is the individual report for **@jpha6542** for the first report.

I have undertaken several roles for the project so that our team can maintain an efficient and straightforward project. We as a team have decided to rotate roles in the beginning of the project so that everyone could have a hand at every role and so can decide what everyone is best at. The main roles I was assigned:

* Customer: I was the second point of contact with the client, as I would often update the client with our smaller updates and conveyed to our group with the demands the clients wanted that week. I would also ask any question our team had for the clients about the unity components. I also ensured that our group stayed on track with the scope and requirements of the project. These are some [images](https://imgur.com/a/HzEvUQU) of our interaction.

* Programmer (Unity) : I ensured that all quality of work in unity was of excellent quality and always delivered on time. I was also the person to understand the simulator code in the unity engine and explained it to the rest of the group this was done through the [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/5ad2d64edde44e702309920fc3299bcd2d52f163) of the map and signs.

* Tracker: I was the tracker for week 3, some of the task were to ask how everyone was going in their respective part of the project and if they need assistance if they were struggling. I was also in charge of the [weekly report](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/commits/b2df58d3c9e1354b194f9a3c90923b880b7a92a3) since I was able to talk to everyone and see where their progress was.

## ***Quality of Work*** ##
For the beginning of the project I mostly worked alone for the unity component but would [constantly update](https://imgur.com/a/jMlQ4Zp) the client to see if my work was to his standard. While also showing him my weekly updates videos in the client meeting to see if quality was good. 

But towards the mid of the project, I started to program in unity with Julian and this can be shown in our discord [logs](https://imgur.com/a/RH0FoXo) but mostly our calls. We constantly updated the simulator whenever me and Julian discovered something better for the simulator this can be seen in the constant [log changes](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/branch/master) in the bit bucket.
## ***Contribution*** ##
### **Technical** ###
My technical contribution was mostly the simulator/unity component of the project. This is as I was initially the person that figured out how to add the [maps](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/645bc86d829503acbfc12310616452922d13fdf9) into donkey car simulator and created 8 signs in blender which where then [imported into unity](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/3a7aab32017509c96aedd043a8ae4997e913320e) and then finally into the simulator. I was also responsible for the [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/5ad2d64edde44e702309920fc3299bcd2d52f163) of the map and sign implementation.

We initially had a problem with how to add the maps into the simulator so I asked the donkey car [discord](https://imgur.com/a/xgQYqOb) but my question was ignored. I then researched more into the donkey car GitHub repository and learnt how most of the simulator works but somethings are still hidden and am working towards fully understanding the everything behind the simulator. I wrote the [instruction](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/history/Installation of Software) to install the software with Patrick.

### **Non-Technical** ###
My non-technical contribution involved understand the simulator, this includes figuring out how the simulator creates environment so that we could run the simulator through our web browser instead. After understanding this, I instructed everyone on how to run the [new simulator](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/9dc0e2a0e21ef2bb7238aeb41feffec5311dd663) with the new maps and how everything worked and guided them through the process in discord call. 

I have also played a role in maintain the quality of the BitBucket Wiki pages, such as help creating templates and updating any pages. I also taken [minutes](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Minutes/Landing) and [weekly report](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Weekly Updates/Landing) for some of the meeting and weeks respectively.

I was also tracker for week 3 as stated above, which boiled down to asking everyone how their progress was going in their respective parts and if I could do anything to help them. This is illustrated through the [weekly report](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/commits/b2df58d3c9e1354b194f9a3c90923b880b7a92a3) in week 3.

I had also helped in the creation of the group report and presentation. For the presentation I was in charge of creating and recording the project goals and user stories. I was also the person editing together everyone part of the presentation so that it flowed well. While for the group report, I helped write and edit the Introduction, Evaluation, Tools, Information Search and Group reflection. 

I’ve also attended most group and client [meetings](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Minutes/Landing) to update our client with our project but to also always know what our client expects of us that week. Also stated above I was the second point of contact with the client asking him questions and letting him keep updated with the changes we thought were important. These are some [images](https://imgur.com/a/HzEvUQU) of our interaction.

While I have attended every team meeting and tutorials so that I stay up to date with what everyone is doing but to also ask questions to the tutor whenever we feel stuck. 
## ***Reflection*** ##
### **Version Control** ###
Version Control for the simulator was relatively easy to handle as it was just me and Julian working on the simulator component so we would often tell each other if we had changed something and if we did we would always pull the new changes before working on our stuff and later just pair programmed so that the version was always the same for both of us. It was also a lot easier due to been able to track the changes through the source tree [history](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/branch/master) menu to always see what each other did. The one thing that I could do better is adding a more detailed messages for my commits.

### **Coding Style** ###
This really wasn’t an issue for the simulator component as most of the coding is just added extra lines in the already given code, so I would copy the formatting of the code so that it was consistent. As the rest of the ‘coding’ was done in unity, where it was more about the creation of new object and changing their properties through the menus. This is illustrated in the [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/commits/0685447d09d1ecb3f66a52bd911b5e75a8f2eb87).

### **Extreme Programming** ###

We initially try to stick to our initial XP roles given in our [group contract](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Group Contract) with success in the tracker and management roles but struggled with the programming roles with dual programming as initial everyone was just trying to figure everything out. However this change further into the project as me and Julian now ‘program’ in unity together quite frequently by sharing our screen and go through our thoughts and process at each step so that we both get our ideas across instead of one person doing work one day and the other another day. We have now decided as a group to be stricter on the XP roles given to us and to follow the procedures more often.

### **Challenges** ###

We initially struggling with how was going to send in the weekly meeting every week, but upon just talking about how we want things to go we were able to decide how it was going to work. I also initially struggled with making the actual environments and maps and tried asking the discord as seen from above. In the end, I overcame this problem by doing some more resource into the GitHub of the donkey car and look into the code and in the end found the solution upon examining multiple files of code. We also struggled to decide where we would update each other as the university wanted everything to be done in slack but we preferred to use discord for updates. In the end we decided to use discord to speak to each other but slack for major updates and changes.

### **Roles** ###

As stated above the main roles I undertook for the group was tracker, customer and even a little bit of being a doomsayer. While the main role I had for this group was to foresee the improvement of the simulator, so being the Unity Expert. This is by understanding the codes and objects but also testing how well our simulator mimics real life and constantly changing it so that its is life-like as possible. 

### **Overall** ###

I feel that the group has been amazing so far but constantly keeping each other up to date with where everyone is up to but also being honest when they feel like they are falling behind. It was also great that when someone was stuck, there was always someone there to help them out and work on it with them. Everyone has also been very friendly and constantly try to keep our group moral up as everyone is excited about this project.

The one thing I would have done better was to start pair programming early so that we could both help each other out instead of each person individually doing research. We should have also been stricter on the XP roles and to follow the concepts more.
