* Client meetings will be on discord from now on rather than zoom
* We still need to improve our NN structure
* Cian has sent us OpenCV code and accuracy results from other teams on discord
* We need to run our tests in a similar format to the other teams and use those test results as a baseline which we can improve on
* We need to try to get things together over the next week, particularly in terms of sign detection
