* Zy is getting in contact with CP34 about sharing our world file with them
* Updated version of timeline in Cian's email:
    - BitBucket repository cleanup -- this weekend
    - Testing setup -- this weekend
    - All detection code complete -- end of week 11
    - All simulator work complete -- end of week 11
    - Full working demo, documentation, video -- end of week 11
* We need to prepare a demo of sign detection for Friday next week
    - This is mainly so Cian can see our progress, and then we have one more week to make improvements
