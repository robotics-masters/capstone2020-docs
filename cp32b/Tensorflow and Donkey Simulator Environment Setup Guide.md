Follow link (1) to install Donkey on your PC. It says to use conda environment, but we have tested and found out it's not necessary. If "pip install -e .[pc]" command doesn't work, try "pip install -e .". Then follow link (2) to install the simulator. It has also guide on how to run the simulator, train a model to drive Donkey car down the page. 

Run pip install tensorflow to install tensorflow (3). If it didn't work out, you can try install it on conda enviornment.
