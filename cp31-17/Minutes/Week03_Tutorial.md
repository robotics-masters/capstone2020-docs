|     1    |     What has been completed?                                |     Setting up the unity environment with the custom maps, slightly refined the turn signal detection                       |               N/A                                                                             |     N/A    |                    N/A                        |

|     3    |     What is working well?                                   |     Off to a good start with fixing the turn signal detection                                                               |             N/A                                                                               |     N/A    |                  N/A                          |
|     4    |     What needs improvement?                                 |     Need to all check the wiki more frequently and update as we go (possible notify the group when wiki updates are made?), issues within blender with texture detection            |                           N/A                                                                 |     N/A    |                   N/A                         |
|     5    |     Reminders                                               |     Weekly meetings begin on the 14th, need a 1 minute video update on what work has been done, finish off scope document   |     Ensure all members are aware of what needs to be done                                  |     Everyone    |  Potential concern around time commitment expectation |
|     6    |     What needs to be completed before the next meeting?     |     Refine the implementation of custom maps in unity, finish off modelling all new signs, finish off scope                 |     Delegate tasks - potentially move people where they are needed                         |     Everyone    |       N/A                                     |
