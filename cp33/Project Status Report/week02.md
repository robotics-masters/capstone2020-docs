| **Project Name** | CP33 - Implementing Object Detection (Object Detection for Simulated Drones) |

| **Quick description** | Using neural networks and/or computer vision to implement object detection for simulated drones. |
| --- | --- |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope**
 | Implement a working sign and obstacle detection algorithm for drones within a simulated environment (Gazebo) |
 |
| **Time**
 | On track |
 |
| **Quality** | Up to standard so far |
 |
| **Planned Activities** | Meet with client and discuss project scopeReview specifications document | Have Gazebo running on everyone&#39;s devices with both Ardupilot and PX4 EnvironmentsShow how to control the drone using code/scriptsShow how to create worlds and drop assetsSigns modelled in GazeboProof of concept for object detection strategyOutline of milestones from now to Week 12 |
| **Achievements** | Met with clientGot Gazebo running on everyone&#39;s device |
 |
| **Major deliverables** | Have Gazebo running on everyone&#39;s devices | Show how to control the drone using code/scriptsSigns modelled in GazeboProof of concept for object detection strategyOutline of milestones from now to Week 12 |
| **Major issues** | No major issues getting in contact with the client and discussing project scope | Issues may arise with trying to control drones using code, but no major issues expected as we are still in the initial stages of getting to learn how to use the platform |
| **Major risks** | Gazebo being incompatible with our devices - overcame this by discussing which OS everyone is using and determining the best drone sim to suit everyone | Gazebo possibly being an unideal drone sim and having to switch to another drone sim |
| **External dependencies**
 | No external dependencies for this week | Need to get everyone up to speed with progress and any documentation/code Robotics Masters has given to us |
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 6 hours | 12 hours |
| **Recorded effort (h)** | 6 hours |

| **Overall Status (RYG)** | Green |
