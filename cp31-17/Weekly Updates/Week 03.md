|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | |
| Report date| 13/09/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | Worked on the Unity Project and OpenCV algorithm  | N/A |
| Time | 20/11/20	 | N/A |
| Quality | Everything seems good so far | N/A |
| Planned activities | Improve OpenCV Sign detection (Wednesday), finish Unity map and sign assets (Friday)  | Improve more on the algorithm component in OpenCV and catch everyone up to speed |
| Achievements | Implemented the new tracks into the simulator, figured out how the environments work, Major improvements in the OpenCV algorithm | N/A |
| Major deliverables | Map implementation, Sign Detection | Deliverables produced or working on next week|
| Major issues | Time commitment proposed by the client seems unrealistic for us | Some people are just learning OpenCV now, so some people are behind |
| Major risks | Not delivering the work required for the week | N/A |
| External dependencies |  None | None |
