**Statement and Extent of Work Done**

XP Roles

- The XP roles I have been assigned so far have been, in order, doomsayer, tracker, manager, tester, and back to doomsayer, which will be my official role going forward
- As tracker, it was very easy to assess everyone&#39;s progress because we are meeting several times a week and we must explain to our tutor and the client how we are progressing.
- As manager, the responsibility of scheduling meetings was not relevant as we have set times for our meetings. However, I did create and share a Zoom link for these meetings.
- My task, while I was tester, was not related to testing. During this time, I did not fulfill this role.

Weekly Plan:

| Week | Intended Work | Completed Work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | N/A | N/A |
| 2 | Downloading Unity and donkey car and getting donkey sim to work, controlling it through localhost | I had some difficulties with this but managed to do it in the time frame. |
| 3 | Modelling Left and Right Turn Signs in Blender | I was able to model the shape of the turn signs but had some issues with the textures. They were visible in Blender but did not show up in Unity. [Summary Video](https://youtu.be/pX64iwf7J68) (created Tuesday Week 4) |
| 4 | Fix texture issues. Install OpenCV. Model Black turning signs and Black and Blue Arrow signs. | Oscar and I were having similar issues with the textures. His signs and my own were not showing up for me in Unity. We managed to fix these issues and Oscar pushed them to the repository. I installed OpenCV but &#39;import cv2&#39; in the python files was throwing an error, even though it worked through terminal. I successfully modelled all the signs I was required to do. [Summary Video](https://youtu.be/jh1SDezBCN8) (created Tuesday Week 5) |
| 5 | Fix OpenCV issues. Test effectiveness of OpenCV parking sign code and make improvements. | I uninstalled and reinstalled OpenCV through pip and this fixed the issue. I also downloaded the testing data and ran the OpenCV code to see how well it worked. I failed to make any improvements, however. |
| 6 | Push new models to the Repository and make pull request. Group/Individual Reports and Demo Presentation | The reports will be completed by deadlines. I edited audio recordings of Presentation edited everything together. |

**Quality of technical work done**

- As mentioned previously, Oscar and I helped each other assure quality of models by testing whether each other&#39;s models worked in Unity on our computers.

- I have not yet made any improvements to the OpenCV code, but have done a pair programming session with Chengdong, reviewing his improvements and discussing what could be done in the future to improve the code. We discussed canny edge detection and the possibility of using that next.

**Other contribution to group processes**

- I have attended all but one group meeting and have attended every client meeting.
- I have been involved in creating and editing the Group Contracts, Meeting Minutes, and Weekly Status Reports
- Issues:
  - Initial sign Modelling: [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/3/signs-modelled-in-simulator) Completed
  - Further signs: [Issue #8](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/8/creating-static-traffic-signs-2) Completed
  - Parking Sign OpenCV code: [Issue #10](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/10/parking-signs) In Progress

**Reflection**

This project has required me to acquaint myself with Unity, donkey car, and Blender. On top of that, I have not used BitBucket before and I have never been involved in a project where I had to push changes to a shared repository. I waited a long time before pushing my changes and should be more prompt in the future to avoid issues with version control and to allow others to access my changes sooner.

Coding style has not been an issue for me yet, as I have done little coding at this point, due to the nature of the project. Going forward, this will become more relevant.

The Extreme Programming aspect of this unit has not been particularly successful for me. The constant changing of roles has resulted in confusion over who is what role for that week and little time to get comfortable with the role and its expectations. I am looking forward to having permanent roles for the rest of semester as this will allow me to fulfill that role with more success.

Project work and teamwork so far has gone very well. Every group member has been contributing and helping each other with issues and questions. The client and tutor have consistently told us we are on track. I am looking forward to completing tasks in the coming weeks which will have more involvement in the programming side of the project as, so far, my computer science knowledge has not been used to a great extent. ** **
