Following an initial meeting with the client, we have the following outline of requirements/timeline. This will be followed at a later time with more formal documentation.

* For the first week and a half, we need to install and run TensorFlow and DonkeyCar on our development machines.

* Simulation: we need to get the simulator work to work so we can test algorithms and make our modifications. We will not need to expand the simulator itself. The other team that is working in parallel with us will be customising the simulator. Cian specifically mentioned that we will need to "drop in assets".

* Algorithm: we will need to create a machine learning algorithm to detect signs and recognise them. Once a sign is recognised we will need to perform actions in the simulator. We will need to collect data to train our algorithms. Cian has suggested we use separate data for training and actual use.

* We need to join the DonkeyCar Discord and the Sydney Univeristy Discord for this

* By the 14th of September we need to have everything set up and assets successfully imported into the simulator. Our first meetings will be on the Monday of that week.

* Every week (starting from the 21st of September) we need to submit a one minute video showing what we have worked on that week. The video might include demonstrations, provide information on what is going on, etc. If you must miss a meeting, upload the video to YouTube (make sure it is private!) and share the link with Cian and/or the team.

* Cian has written some OpenCV code that may come in useful. We are basically going to have to translate this into TensorFlow.

* Around weeks 7 and 12 we will have "VentureCafe"; this is to do with entrepreneurship. We will be required to attend a few.

# Update 2020-10-04

We have lost a team member, so our requirements have been adjusted. Here is the latest that was sent to us by Cian on September 23rd:

>(I have had a busy week and have not been able to formally write this up for your adjusted scope)Your scope adjustment will be something similar to this:TensorFlow Detection Final Deliverable

>    Stop Sign
>    Traffic Lights
>    Turning Signs (left/right) - circles only, blue & black
>    Parking Signs - green & white only
>    Documentation

>Simulator Final Deliverable

>    Implement Circuit & Challenge Course with Signs (already complete)
>    Signs as per above list (for testing purposes)
>    Documentation

>Removed (for transparency) for smaller team:

>    SIM - Implementing two other tracks in Simulator (Baby Park, Alberto Park)
>    TF - turning signs - rectangular / arrow shape
>    TF - yellow park sign
>    TF - speed sign
>    SIM - other car models

>All other expectations stay in place.  Please let me know if this is clear.

>And also note, please focus strongly on the Tensorflow detection and models for the rest of the semester.  Including testing and collecting data in the simulator.
