 - Should we be using a specific neural net structure for traffic sign detection?
 - Aims for the next week:
	- Drop signs into world
	- Link tensorflow detection linked with Gazebo
 - How should the drone be flying around? Cian says a path  should be set with GPS waypoints, with the drone responding to signs along the way.
