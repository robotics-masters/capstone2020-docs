- **Weekly Plan vs Achievements**

Week 2

The plan was to properly install donkeycar and the required portions of the project, as detailed in the [first Meeting Minutes](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Meeting%20minutes/Week%202%20-%20Meeting%20minutes%20-%20Client) for Week 2.

The necessary components were downloaded : Unity, Blender, Donkeycar, DonkeySim, and ways to communicate (Discord, Slack app), as mentioned in ["Discussion to install this week's applications"](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Individual%20Reports/Oscar's%20Evidence/Week2) .

Week 3

In the final meeting of Week 2, the plan for Week 3 was established : Add in models for the stop sign and parking sign. It is further detailed in Issue # 4 on the Bitbucket repository.

During the week, I added the stop sign and parking sign to the repo, as seen in [this commit](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/0df8b9630dc4fd26bc9eca35a97ad111c1cd43ca) and this [commit](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/ed1e24348ed2991a4b8c31f8f24701d67b0e69cc).

This was later merged in to main branch. The pull request is [here](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/pull-requests/6/stop-sign/diff).

In addition, I contributed to getting textures to work for models in Unity, as can be seen in this page on the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Pair%20Programming%20Evidence/Discussion/Tamara-Oscar-14-Sep) where Tamara and I discussed what needs to be done to get textures to appear on Unity for imported models. This is summarised in my summary video for [week 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOnvg3goaD0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=OscarG).

Week 4

In the meeting, I was assigned the next series of models, mentioned in the [first Week 4 Meeting Minutes](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Meeting%20minutes/Week%204%20-%20Meeting%20minutes%20-%20Client%202%20+%20Team).

The corresponding issue is [https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888\_t13a\_group5/issues/7/7-creating-static-traffic-signs](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/7/7-creating-static-traffic-signs) .

I started the new signs (the variants of the Parking Signs), which were added to the repository under the [New Signs branch](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/465766e630f7109ffe582c6df3ed4fd71a2bc358?at=New-Signs) in Week 5

Week 5

In week 5, I finished the 2 signs, and since there were no new static signs, I moved to trying to update and test the OpenCV code. Specifically, I was tasked with the stop sign. The corresponding issue is here : [Issue 9](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/9/testing-and-modification-of-stop-sign) ([https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888\_t13a\_group5/issues/9/testing-and-modification-of-stop-sign](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/9/testing-and-modification-of-stop-sign)).

This week, I managed to modify the OpenCV code to be in the form of a class, with the detection algorithm in a function so that it could be edited more easily in the future, and so that unit testing could proceed more smoothly than for a single function without a class. This was done in the [New-Signs](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/branch/New-Signs) branch where the stop sign was converted into the class\_stop.py and the test file was created as Stop\_UnitTest.py alongside the new signs' fbx files. This was mentioned in the [Week 5 summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBp5eCvabDQ).

Week 6

This week, the plan was to work on the group and individual reports, though based on information from the tutor, the test file was expanded. Specifically, it now tests for the edge cases of each function, and for the class variables depending on initiation function.

This can be seen in the latest commits to the [StopSign-OOP-and-Tests branch's first commit](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/e0ee41cabe4610a0822b66ddcdb92d770e7abe37?at=StopSign-OOP-and-Tests).

In addition, the AI training that was tasked of us was done in this week with redone TUB data from driving through the track again after improving at driving. This can be seen in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDP01YMADlY&amp;ab_channel=OscarG) of the AI driving with the training done as a model.

**Quality of Technical Work Done**

I made use of discussions with team mates, including pair programming, as well as making use of test cases, and having other review my code in order to ensure that my work was done with quality, and refactoring based on feedback.

Discussion was made in meetings on Zoom calls, which were recorded and placed into the wiki : [here](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/browse/Meeting%20minutes). (https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888\_t13a\_group5/wiki/browse/Meeting%20minutes)

In addition, we communicated over slack, discord, and most often, Messenger. Examples of Messenger discussion can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/browse/Individual%20Reports/Oscar's%20Evidence/Discussions%20w).

I also made use of pair programming with Osama and Keenan, where I shared my screen and showed my thought processes and went over my written code. This was very useful for bug fixing and going over future plans. [Evidence1](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Pair%20Programming%20Evidence/Osama-Oscar-26-09-2020)[Evidence 2](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Pair%20Programming%20Evidence/Oscar-Keenan-03-10-2020)

Code was refactored based on discussions with the tutor. For me, this came in the form of the unit tests being clarified, which lead me to adding in a number of edge case tests and specific tests for different functions rather than just testing the end result of the normal usage of the code. The original code can be seen [here](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/465766e630f7109ffe582c6df3ed4fd71a2bc358?at=master), where it is mostly a test of what results are being correctly detected. The [updated code](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/commits/e0ee41cabe4610a0822b66ddcdb92d770e7abe37?at=master) has tests of individual tests, and trying to find out whether different inputs into the function would result in the expected output.

**Group Processes**

I was a participant and signed into each Group Contract. [W2-5](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Group%20contract)[W6+](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/Group%20Contract%20W6+)

I participated in group discussions which were detailed in meeting minutes.

In addition, a few sessions of pair programming were done, with Osama, and Keenan. These involved live, one screen analysis of code. With Keenan, we also went through ways to complete the remaining tasks of the week – updating AI training and the different reports.

The issues I started were the initial models' [# 4](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/4/signs-modelled-in-simulator-2), the second round of models' [#7](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/7/7-creating-static-traffic-signs), and the updated stop sign, [#9](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/issues/9/testing-and-modification-of-stop-sign). The former two were completed, with one of them awaiting the merging of a branch to resolve. The latter is still in development, though some progress has been made, as written there.

In addition, my weekly progress was placed into the wiki in [Weekly Updates](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/browse/Weekly%20update), so team members would know what tasks have been done.

**Reflection**

At first, my grasp of version control was not too great. I ended up making no commits due to being on the local master branch, which was updated by merging only. I ended up making a branch and pushing my changes there, and had no issues with version control afterwards.

My major challenge was how the different the tasks were to previous units. For example, I had never done any modelling, used Unity, or made use of OpenCV. As such, it was an uphill battle to work out how to complete some of the tasks. However, now that I've done models, and started on the OpenCV section, I feel better prepared for the rest of this project. In addition, discussion with teammates with experience helped lessen the confusion.

My role changed a few times, but as the tracker, I made sure to contribute to the meeting minutes and clarify with all members what they did and whether what they did would necessitate the removal of tasks to complete from the table, as well as modifying it to markdown and editing it to have it show up on the Wiki. As the manager, and programmer, I just wrote down client specifications which were put into the meeting minutes, and wrote tests respectively.

As I am now permanently the tracker, I will be looking to streamline the task of checking with team members with better teammates to track progress by having a set time in each meeting, or to ask them via slack/messenger about their activity so that the discussion about task progress during big meetings can be made less time-consuming.

As a software engineer, I was in the pair that made the models for the first 4 weeks, then transitioned into trying to edit the stop sign OpenCV code. This was difficult, but pair programming with Osama helped alleviate the late entry into the OpenCV section of the project. Since I was focused on testing, I made sure to edit the code such that it was object oriented which made it easier to write unit tests and acceptance tests for it, especially as the code is improved upon, due to its more flexible nature.

The project work has progressed well, with the only things left being improvements to code, or adding in code for other signs. The way I interact with the team could be better streamlined by placing details of questions and clarifications into the Slack channels, and any text-based discussions to be placed in Wiki for easier review and as evidence for later reports.

**Writing and Wiki Use Quality**

I made regular additions to the wiki in the form of Weekly Update videos, and the meeting minutes, whether it was via adding to the document or editing and uploading it to the wiki. This can be seen in the participants section in every meeting minutes page.

The group contract that I uploaded were edited to prevent badly organised tables from occurring due to the lack of ways to allow dot points to show up within cells. As such, I just added images of those sections in from the Google Docs.

Otherwise, the meeting minutes I edited made use of tables to properly organise different sections of interest. They are also placed into specific folders with related articles if there are any. Those that are not related are kept in the main folder. The wiki articles can be found via a link I added in the article that the wiki sidebar redirects towards, which allows for easy navigation.
