Notes:

* Accuracy results for the client:
	* Run scenario (i.e. drive past the sign) - should get around 100 frames.
	* Report accuracies as percentages - true positives, false positives, missed detections
	* Report for all signs. Traffic lights are optional.
	* Results used by the Client to compare other teams' models.
		* Client will work towards collecting the standard dataset for all teams over the next 10 days.
* Simulator:
    * Cian sent us a fence fbx file on discord that we can use to surround our tracks.
* Multi-team meeting:   
    * Cian will organise a meeting (probably Wednesday) with the other teams to share tips & tricks for creating the remaining tracks.
    * Cian might have a tub for a driver for track 1 for us at this meeting so we can train a good driver model.
