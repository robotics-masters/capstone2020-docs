* Sign detection still needs more improvement
* Need to link up OpenCV components
    - Myx can sort of detect stop, turn and park signs
* For client deployment, focus on getting the 4 core signs working, then try to include other signs if possible:
    - Stop
    - Park
    - Left
    - Right
* Final client demo likely pushed back to Thursday Week 13 (26th)
