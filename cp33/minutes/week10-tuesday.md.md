* Cian to send some more accurate OpenCV code tomorrow for Myx
* Gio has implemented some testing code as requested by Cian
    - Results to be sent to Cian over discord tonight
* Our current model is still just using full frames, but we may be able to make a better model if we can get bounding boxes working
    - However, this would force a change in our training data
