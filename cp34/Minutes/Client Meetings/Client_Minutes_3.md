## Agenda

Meeting started at: 6:00 PM

| Agenda Item | Description | Decision | Who? |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| World loading and testing | Find bottleneck for world loading in terms of resources used (ie cpu, ram, etc) | Keep working on the weather | All Team Members |
| Charging Stations | They should be basic blocks or shapes, nothing fancy The world files are in XML format, so it is easy to change it using code, thus changing object location is easy | Creating charging stations and developing a script to randomize their location within the world file | Dylan |
| Drone path finding algorithm testing | Basic command line argument for the path finding algorithm which replicates the simulator | Design and write the algorithm in any coding languages | William, Jimmy |
| What needs improvement? | Have more team members with working with both simulators, ArduPilot and PX4 | Get more team members to configure Ardupilot, PX4 | All Team Members |
| Scripting for both PX4 and ArduPilot | MAVLink python library pymavlink is sufficient to code with for both flight stacks | Use paired programming and XP programming methods to write a simple script for point to point navigation that works for both flight stacks (ie PX4 & ArduPilot) | Justin, Dylan, Nicholas |
