| **Quick description** | Improving on Algorithms for computer vision without neural networks, using models and tracks in an Unity project. |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Improve OpenCv code and implement the changes into the simulator. | Integrate the traffic sign code into the simulator and ensure the car makes the right decision based on the sign seen. |
| **Time** | We are hoping we can get everything working in the simulator by next Tuesday, we will have to explore it a bit more to see how long it will take. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | Good so far, lighting still needs to be experimented with a bit more. | Good so far. Work required on other traffic signs detection improvement. |
| **Planned Activities** | Integrate the OpenCv code into the simulator.Simulator config reading | Get a prototype working for the client. |
| **Achievements** | OpenCV detection working in the simulator. Turning sign detection accuracy improved significantly.Traffic lights cycle state on timer | N/A |
| **Major deliverables** | OpenCV code working in the simulator. | Get a working prototype of the simulator for the client. |
| **Major issues** | There aren&#39;t any more improvements we can make to the OpenCV code so we will chat with the client on what he&#39;d like us to work on next. | Improvements to the other traffic sign are still a work in progress. |
| **Major risks** | Potential risk that we won&#39;t get the logic of making the donkey car react to different signs implemented by next tuesday. | N/A |
| **External dependencies** | N/A | N/A |
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 35 | 37 |
| **Recorded effort (h)** | 32 | |
