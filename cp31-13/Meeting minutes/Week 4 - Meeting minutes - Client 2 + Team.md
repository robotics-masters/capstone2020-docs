| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | What has been completed? | - 2nd Weekly Client Meeting- Traffic Light model- Most of the new signs are done- Lighting Improvements-Donkey car parts implemented | Work completed | The Team | N/A |
| **2** | What is in progress? | - Programming traffic light logic- OpenCV Improvements- blue and black arrow signs still to be modelled- All members to train AI drivers | Continue to work on these items for next client meeting | Team | n/a |
| **3** | What is working well? | Implementation of the tracks.Implementation of the sign modelsImprovements to the OpenCV code.Implementation of the donkey parts | Team members will continue working on their areas. | Team | n/a |
| **4** | What needs improvement? | - Lighting could potentially be improved further to just use 1 light source instead of 2.- Traffic lights could be modelled more accurate to reality- slack communication | - Traffic lights: Look into better ways of handling lighting objects in Unity | Johnny: Traffic Light improvements | n/a |
| **5** | Reminders | - Keenan AI Training instructions- Send Cian what line of the Donkey parts code had to be changed- Summary videos for next tuesday | - Document how to train AI | Keenan | n/a |
| **6** | What needs to be completed before the next meeting? | Implementation of more signs in the simulator.All members training their own AIImprovements to the OpenCV solution for the turning traffic signs | Team members will continue working on their assigned tasks. | Team | n/a |
