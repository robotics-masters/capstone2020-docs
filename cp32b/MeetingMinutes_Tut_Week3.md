| 1   | What has been completed?                            | We chatted to our tutor about things we need to deliver to the client. We further discussed about how to start our project by looking through a range of paper on bioreactor design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | We are also going to chat to the supervisor about our concern on the final delivery.                                                         | The team           | n/a                  |
| 2   | What is in progress?                                | Research on bioreactor design.     | We are going to read through more paper, gain an idea of what input/output needed for the bioreactor (paper on slack).                             | The team     |  N/A                  |
| 3   | What needs improvement?                             | We need to get started on the research of following topic: Object-oriented architecture/Design patterns, real time computing, embedded systems | We will talk about these in the next group meeting. It will be best if members start on research before next meeting. | The Team | N/A                  |
