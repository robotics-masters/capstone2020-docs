Oscar : 

 - Created Parking Sign code for Black and White Parking signs

 - Attempted using pyTesseract for recognising characters in the sign, though testing seems to show it isn't very effective. Currently trying to a better mask to test it as part of the Parking Sign Code.

Keenan :

 - Worked on implementing the brake system

 - Changed the camera resolution and trained a new AI for it (AI is still dumb)

Osama :

- Reworked the turn sign algorithm (blue background) to work in the simulator

- Integrated the detection code into the simulator so the car could take action (turn left/right) on a detection

Johnny :

- Worked with Keenan to implement brake communication between sim and donkey vehicle

- Worked with client to integrate brake features with his up to date version of the project and submit a PR to distribute our new feature

Tamara :

- Attempted to use orb for feature matching.

- Attempted to use canny to detect edges of sign

Chengdong Fu:

- download and run the latest simulator on my computer with Keenan's help

- improve the park code for the simulator work. (changes color filter a bit, fix some mistakes i've made in color check functions)
