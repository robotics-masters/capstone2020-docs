# Individual Report - Julian Jee #
## Roles and Responsibilities: ##
For this project, I have been given the role of Blender expert and oversaw any modelling tasks that had to be carried out by the team. Any problems other members or the client had with the model quality was brought up to me and was my responsibility to handle such situations. This role also included frequency communication and collaboration with our Unity Expert Joseph to implement our specified objects into the simulator. 
For traditional XP roles, I was assigned as the Manager for Week 3, later becoming a permanent role. As the manager, my job was the keep in constant communication with the rest of the team, take advice from our Customer and delegate tasks accordingly to their priority. I also suggested when to have additional team meetings and made sure that all other members were kept informed of them.

## Contributions: ##

### Technical ###
My main contributions to the group project have mainly been with making improvements to the simulator, as evidenced by my commits to the [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/src/master/). At the start of the project, I researched into installing the required software and helped the rest of the group with troubleshooting installation problems. 
Once we received our scope and requirements by our client, I modelled the batch of signs required for the first sprint in Blender: a stop, left turn, right turn and park sign and exporting them to work in the simulator environment. This experience was shared with the rest of the team as I ran through them the steps needed to implement their own models correctly.

For the next sprint, I trained a Keras autopilot for the car to utilise in testing, with a video demo present in our Week 4 report. I have also modelled a toggleable traffic light fully functioning in the simulator using Unity and C# scripting. In addition, I assisted the team with tidying up the simulator by renaming, adjusting the size of, and removing unnecessary objects. This included changing the lighting conditions of the track, placing the sign objects into our maps and rescaling/remodelling the objects. 

### Non-Technical ###
For my non-technical contributions, I have been a frequent contributor to our meeting minutes for our team and client meetings as well as the weekly reports. I also assisted with proofreading and editing our documentation required for importing objects into the simulator, [found in our wiki](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Installation%20of%20Software). 
With communication, I have been constantly on alert for messages and have quickly replied to other members if they had any questions or progress. If any problems had arisen during work, I did not hesitate to contact our client and ask for assistance or approval with our current direction. I’ve attended every group meeting that I could make and asked my other members of what occurred when I couldn’t be there.

## Reflection: ##

### Version Control ###
Our version control was managed using Bitbucket. While other members had been branched off to work on their respective parts, I worked with the master branch containing the existing Unity program provided by our client as my commits simply had been adding new objects. Merging branches when our detection algorithms had to be implemented was a smooth process that was handled with the whole team present. 

### Coding Styles ###
As my job involved little coding, code legibility not a large concern for me. However, the other members in the group that did have coding roles walked through their respective code to ensure that I would still fully understand their work and kept up to date with their progress. For the scripting done in C#, I based by coding style on tutorials from Unity’s official website as well as utilising comments so that I wrote could be understood by others.

### Extreme Programming ###
We followed XP guidelines to assign roles to our team, present in our [group contract](https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/comp3888_t17a_group5/wiki/Group%20Contract), rotating in the first 3 weeks and then later solidifying them. While there was some initial confusion in what I had to do, discussion with the other members helped me to understand my responsibilities. 
Pair programming, while a key aspect of XP, was not used as almost no coding was involved with my tasks. However, to emulate this, I worked together with Joseph when modelling and implementing objects by sharing screens and discussion through Discord. 
The use of weekly sprints played a key factor in getting tasks done on time and helped me to keep track of the progress made each week for both myself and others. 

### Challenges ###
Over the course of this project, we have run into some challenges, which we have mostly overcome.

*** System Compatibility ***
Half of our members used MacOS while the other half worked on Windows. As such, in the beginning there was a lot of confusion with installation as our system architecture was different. However, by splitting the teams by OS, the two groups were able to work with each other to resolve each other’s problems. 

*** Task Delegation ***
As our project was split between two aspects of improving sign detection algorithms and the simulator testing software, there was the challenge of each side having no familiarity with what the other side was doing. To resolve this, communication was highly important during team meetings to keep each half in the light about the other and vice versa. Overall, this had been highly successful and kept everyone up to date as well.

*** Communication ***

While Slack was designated to us as the primary method of communication, most of our group preferred communicating through Discord as well as our client. As a result, there were messages being sent and lost on the two platforms. However, through our client’s urging, we managed to convince our tutor that Discord would be the preferred way of communication. 

## Future Improvements ##

### Scheduling ###
There have been times where various team members could not make it to meetings without informing or were late to meetings. Due to one of us being overseas in Canada, it was hard scheduling times where we could all comfortably meet. 

## Roles as a software developer ##
My role as a software developer has been software developer have been not only being able to work on my individual part but understand and collaborate with the team as a whole to create a unified vision of the project. This involved constant communication with the rest of the team to ensure I understood what everyone else was up to and they knew of my progress. 
My role also involved communication with the client to fully grasp their needs and obtain feedback on current progress. This has been evidenced through our Discord channel, where images of my models have been shared and suggestions later made by the client for me to work on. 
As discussed earlier, my tasks have been:
Week 2: Install and understand DonkeySim as a testing environment
Week 3: Modelled 4 traffic signs and implemented them into DonkeySim
Week 4: Trained AI to drive in DonkeySim and modelled/scripted traffic light
Week 5: Modelled second car to be implemented into the simulator.

For my future responsibilities, I would be more involved with creating new tracks for the simulator and help create tests for our sign detection code.
