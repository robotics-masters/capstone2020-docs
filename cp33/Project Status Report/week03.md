| **Quick description** | Using neural networks and/or computer vision to implement object detection for simulated drones. |
| ---                   | ---                                                                                              |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Implement a working sign and obstacle detection algorithm for drones within a simulated environment (Gazebo) | |
| **Time** | Behind | |
| **Quality** | Up to standard so far | |
| **Planned Activities** | Set up gazebo with ardupilot and PX4. Have four signs modelled. Formulate proof of concept for object detection | Have trees and plants in the customised world. Create assets of all signs and objects into simulators. install and configure gazebo simulator Tools with px4. Build a simulated residential environment in the simulator. |
| **Achievements** | Some members have Gazebo, Ardupilot and PX4 running. | |
| **Major deliverables** | Having Gazebo, ardupilot running on everyone’s device. Able to control drones using code (MAVSDK-Python). Some models are completed. | Model trees and plants in the simulator Create assets of all the signs and objects into the simulator Build a simulated residential environment in the simulator |
| **Major issues** | We encountered significant difficulties in trying to get the software set up on everyone’s computers as Gazebo only seems to work well with Linux. We got around this by dual booting / using VMs. | Issues may arise in the form of Gazebo being too resource-intensive and not running well enough for us to build and place models. |
| **Major risks** | Gazebo is incompatible with our devices, so all of the members are using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, either dual boot or on VM now. | Gazebo may be incapable to produce certain models so external tools may be required |
| **External dependencies** | No external dependencies for this week | Need to get everyone up to speed with progress and any documentation/code Robotics Masters has given to us |
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 12 hours | 15 hours |
| **Recorded effort (h)** | 12 hours | |
| **Overall Status (RYG)** | Yellow | |
