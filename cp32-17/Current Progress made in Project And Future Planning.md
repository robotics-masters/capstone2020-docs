The current progress of the team has been as follows:
1)	The following tracks have been imported successfully into the simulator, namely , Brabham’s track , Baby Mario , track 1 and track 2 
2)	Various assets(traffic signs) have been imported into the simulator.
3)	 We have got the simulator working. We’ve set up the python client to connect to the server.
4)	The model has been trained to drive the car autonomously
5)	The F1 car has been modelled into the simulator
6)	Besides , I have written the required image classification code for sign detection(stop sign or not).The classification is for a binary class using sigmoid activation function(non linear) . 
7)	I have also extended it for multi class sign detection/classification using softmax activation function.So , now it is able to perform image classification using TensorFlow 2.3.0 for 6 types of traffic signs- stop , left turn , right turn , park , speed and others. 
8)	The sign detection code has been integrated into the simulator successfully.

The future planning would be as follows: 

We have to extend this such that the necessary actions can be taken by the car on detecting the traffic signs.
