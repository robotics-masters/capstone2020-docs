|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|What has been completed?|Discussed what was done in previous meetings, research of new technologies (voicing of concerns) and clarification of documentation and plan for the weekend.|Fill in the group members that were absent on what we talked about|All|N/A|
|2|What is in progress?| Working on getting the algorithms to be able to run in the donkeycar environment and implementation of new signage models and code. | Everyone to continue with their progress and reconvene when the simulator is up and running with code.|All|N/A|
|3|What is working well?|Seem to be meeting the requirements of the client quite well and he is happy with our progress.|N/A|N/A|N/A|
|4|What needs improvement? |Need to evaluate if it is possible to greatly improve the algorithms |N/A|N/A|N/A|
|5|Reminders|Traffic lights are under our discretion with the script, but recommends the use of a button within the simulator to greatly improve customisation with training.|N/A|N/A|N/A|
|6|What needs to be completed before the next meeting?|Implementation of simulator with code, continue researching opencv solutions, generate more information for the presentation, demo and report, implement more signs in unity and opencv. Also if we cannot improve the algorithm then work on getting new signs into the source code.|N/A|N/A|N/A|
