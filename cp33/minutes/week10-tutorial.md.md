* Need to start working on writing final reports
* CI pipeline not looking very feasible for integration tests
    - Frank: nice to have integration tests on CI pipeline but not necessary, Boswell and Zy working it
* NN unit tests: need to test NN training code, in addition to testing predictions of specific NNs as we are already doing
* For now, aim for Tuesday week 12 for final presentation
