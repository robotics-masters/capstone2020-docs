| **Quality**              | - Code quality so far is fair. Since we are adapting code from other sources as instructed by the client<br>- Team work and meeting is of higher quality than before as we are getting on track. |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Planned Activities**   | - Project scope confirmed.<br>- Simulator and tensorflow set up on person devices<br>- Running a trained donkey car in the simulator<br>- Stop and left, right turn sign classification          | - Further improve existing classification code<br>- Gathering data in donkey car simulator to train the model<br>- Build models for other signs<br>- Build a virtual racing league web leaderboard |
