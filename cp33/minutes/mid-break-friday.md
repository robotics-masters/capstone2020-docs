* The team was not able to do a practice client demo today due to image size issues
* Model trained on 128 x 128 images, mismatch with input data from drone camera (360 x 640)
* Need to use OpenCV to crop images in a consistent way
* Need to look at how to extract objects from OpenCV
    - Cian to send us some Python code from another group to help with this
* Team will now do a practice client demo during Tuesday Week 7 meeting
* Actual (assessed) client demo will take place during Friday Week 7 meeting
    - Will be in the form of a recorded Zoom meeting
* Length of client demo: approximately 5 minutes is fine
* Content of client demo
    - Need to show as much of a "final product" as possible
    - Backend parts don't need to be shown
