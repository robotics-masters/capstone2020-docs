1) Usage of a pre-trained model to detect objects in an image
2) Usage of CNN for traffic light detection(specifically for mapping indices(1,2,3) to string labels(Red,Green,Yellow))
3) Added code for model preparation , loaded label maps (mapping indices to category names such as Red,Green,Yellow)
4) Loaded image into numpy array
5) Detection and testing models,printing length of test images
6) Written function to visualize results of detection in forms of boxes and scores
7) Created video from list of images
8) Definite input and output tensors for detection graph
9) Array based representation used to prepare result image with boxes and labels on it
