| **Team name** | COMP3988\_T17B\_Group5 |
| **Project Name** | CP33 - Implementing Object Detection (Object Detection for Simulated Drones) |
| **Project start date** | Monday, 24/08/2020 |
| **Project end date** | Friday, 20/11/2020 |
| **Project point person** | Boswell Lin |

| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Implement a working sign and obstacle detection algorithm for drones within a simulated environment (Gazebo) ||
| **Time**| Up to date ||
| **Quality** | Up to standard so far ||
| **Planned Activities** | Snapshot support for the manual drone controller for better collecting data.| - Incorporate OpenCV code provided by Cian - Plan out testing framework and implement it |
| **Achievements** | Snapshot support for the manual dronecontroller for better collecting data. |
| **Major deliverables** | -Complete the traffic lights throughout the test environment - Manual drone control | Testing framework - integration testing and CIpipeline |
| **Major issues** | OpenCV - unable to extract sections of the framewhere the sign exists - this may present anincompatibility issue for us hindering the accuracy | OpenCV unable to extract bounding boxes |
| **Major risks** | Feeding the neural network with frames includingthe background - there is a risk that this mayreduce the accuracy of the NN for sign detection - Training large dataset may cause out of memory. | Sign detection with Tensorflow is not accurate - OpenCV code may be difficult to incorporate |
| **External dependencies**| No external dependencies for this week | No external dependencies for next week|
| **Estimated effort (h)** | 15 hours | 15 hours |
| **Recorded effort (h)** | 15 hours |
 |
| **Overall Status (RYG)** | Yellow |
