| **Status item** | **Status up to last week** | **Planned for next week** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope**   | Develop a world simulation in Unity where we can run our Donkey cars.
Use OpenCV to be able to detect different signs on the road and have our cars react accordingly. | Work our way through the donkey car simulation docs and get started with installing the simulator and running a basic simulation. |
| **Time**   | On track with our deadlines so far. | Have the simulator running on all members computers in the next week |
| **Quality** | N/A | Want to have the simulations functioning on our systems without any bugs or errors. |
| **Planned Activities** | Meet with client and discuss requirements, consistent meeting times and channels of communication | Have all team members set up the simulation environment. |
| **Achievements** | Communicated with the team and decided on timings for weekly meetings. | Get everyone to install and run Donkey car simulator on their machinesInstall all necessary packages |
