Notes:

* Live demo:
    * All demo footage can be pre-recorded, but we need to provide live-commentary. All demo videos should be recorded standalone first (raw clips) to be used for the client demo, then our webcam video should be superimposed afterwards for the tutor demo.
    * The slides at the start of the demo should be shown live.

* Soft deadline:
    * All demo/presentation videos should be completed by Wednesday night so integration can begin.
