# Project CP31

**Project Title:**  Sign Detection using only OpenCV  
**Project Team:** COMP3888 T17A Group 5  
**Tutor:** Abdallah Lakhdari  

## Project Description

`We attempt to use OpenCV without any Artifical Intelligence components to learn to recognise signs. We wish to further allow the appropriate actions for the autonomous vehicle to make upon the recognition of the sign. Another component of this project is making improvements to the simulation, specifically the addition of signs and race track maps.`
