9 . **Participation and Commitment**

[x] We undertake to participate fully and work as a team.

*What does this mean?*

Attending tutorials and meeting on time (5 minutes early, start on XX:00). Regular, proactive contact and discussion. Check instant messages daily. 4-6 hours during own time towards project. Following rules.

*How will you demonstrate that this is taking place? E.g. meeting deadlines, completing your allocated tasks on time*

Regular updates about our progress. Trying to always finish deadlines on time.

10 . **Group Conflict**

[x] We will discuss any problems, listen carefully to all points of view and negotiate a solution.

Slack, Bitbucket (Issues)

*How will you demonstrate agreement?*

- Majority vote/coin flip for tie in small projects

*When will you escalate conflict to your tutor?*

When we need outside perspective or tie for a big decision

11 . **Presentation Rehearsal**

[x] We will ensure that each group member is ready for the Group Demo Rehearsal

We will schedule a meeting before the presentation dedicated for the rehearsal 2 weeks before it is due. Another meeting the week before the presentation will also be scheduled if everyone does not feel confident/more work needed to be done. This will be done during the backup meeting time on Wednesday on Zoom.

12 . **Task Allocation**

[x] We will distribute the work fairly and equitably

We will aspire to be dependable group members who carry out the tasks assigned in an appropriate time manner as well covering people who are unable to perform their tasks for a variety of reasons. For this reason we will establish strong lines of communication to ensure everyone is updated on the situation with regards to the project.

We will use the Agile methodology to split work into pairs. The work will be split between coding and observing, swapping each work session. This will ensure that each member has at least one other person to compare to with their workload. Pairs will present and discuss their work to the rest of the group during the meetings. At each of the weekly meetings, the group will delegate pairs on what needs to be done. If the pair feels like their workload is too heavy/light, the amount of people allocated to the task will be adjusted as needed.

In the event of a member being unable to complete their work other members will carry the load in an even and fair manner.
