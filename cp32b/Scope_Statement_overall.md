|**Background:** _The context for this project_   |We are moving closer to autonomous cars and drones every day and finding new ways of using AI in the real world in other applications (fighting pandemics, object classification).Students will be looking at existing techniques and creating new software solutions to detect a number of predefined traffic signs using Neural Networks (TensorFlow). Teams will look at different technologies and come up with a solution that is reliable and efficient. This will involve data collection and cleaning. TensorFlow 2 is recognised as one of the preferred libraries for completing AI tasks.|
| **Aim** _Purpose of the project._ | The aim of this project is to detect signs and objects using TensorFlow and improve the Donkey Car simulator environment. |
| **Objectives (SMART):**_Goals of the project._ |`Our team will collaborate through Jira and bitbucket and set up the milestones of deliveries to use TensorFlow2 to detect traffic signs and improve simulators, which students can get familiar with the detection algorithms within the next 3 months.`  `Specific:` `This is an important project since TensorFlow is increasingly important nowaday.` `The teams will collaborate through google doc. We will meet twice a week without clients (either online or offline) and once a week(if required) online in zoom.` `We also share our works on Wiki and collaborate through Jira and bitbucket. We will also discuss questions on discord.`  `Measurable:` `In order to track our progress towards our goal, we plan to meet with all team members twice a week (either online or offline). And we also set up the milestones of deliveries.`  `Achievable:` `This is an aggressive goal, given how much knowledge we need to gain before we are able to do the work, but it&#39;s certainly attainable as we will assign tasks to different members.`  `Relevant:` `We‘ll ensure this project stays relevant by keeping referring to the successful criteria and deliverables. As a safeguard, we’ll make sure that we have meetings with the client twice a week to stay on track.`  `Time-bound:` `By requiring that the final product is done by 15/11/2020 (within 3 months). This goal is time-related.` |
| **Success Criteria:** _What does success look like for the sponsor and how can it be measured. _ |`1. Finish the two major components (Simulators improvement and signs detection) each with two milestones and demonstrate the results successfully.` `2. Students are also expected to do lots of research to ensure the best solutions are found, with research recorded in the appropriate repository and format.` `3. Documentation must be included with all work completed in a format that is legible and understandable.`|
| **Deliverables** _List the outputs that will be produced as part of the project including the final product or service._ |`1. Process documentation (as per each Milestone)` `2. The code base libraries` `3. Demo of working solution in simulator` `4. Demo of working solution on real-world track (TBD)` `5. Published Jupyter Notebook involving the testing of a system` ` Simulator improvement` `1. New Tracks &Environments:` `-- Imported Track 1 (Robotics Masters Simple)` `-- Imported Track 2 (Robotics Masters Challenge Course)` `-- Imported Track 3 (One-way Circuit) – by automatic generation` `d. Imported Track 4 (Albert Park) – by automatic generation` `2. Objects:` `-- All signs (in table) modelled in the simulator and able to be placed at set locations` `-- New Donkey Car from RoboCarStore modelled in simulator` `3. Features:` `-- Automatic track generation from PNG or JPG image for flat tracks` `-- Random placement of an object (traffic cone) on the track` `4. Extended:` `-- Students welcome to improve any other aspect of the Unity Simulator that they feel is required.`||**Scope** _The work that needs to be accomplished in order to deliver/complete the project._ |`A. Simulator Additions (Week 3)` `-- Add two new track layouts (outlined in email)` `-- Add objects to map` `B. TensorFlow minor sign detection (Week 6)` `-- Show primitive model working on initially provided 4 signs (stop, turning, parking, traffic lights)` `-- Demo on sample data and in simulator (different environments)` `C. Simulator Enhancements (Week 9)` `-- Improve and documented new fast way to import new track layouts` `-- Add up to two additional (four total) track layouts to simulator and document process` `-- Further improvements and documenting for placing objects (signs, traffic lights, objects)` `-- Random placement of objects (cones)` `-- Model new Donkey Car (RoboCarStore) into simulator as a vehicle` `D. TensorFlow major detection (Week 9)` `-- All outlined signs and objects (total 12 unique objects in table) detected and corresponding action response` `-- Demo on sample data and in simulator (different environments)` `-- Simulator improvements completed and demo / video showing process to import new objects and tracks.` `-- All tracks and objects imported and placeable in simulator`|
