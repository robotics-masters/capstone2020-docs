| **Scope** | Create our group report and presentation | Integrate the traffic sign code into the simulator and ensure the car makes the right decision based on the sign seen. |
| **Time** | Simulator has been successfully integrated with OpenCv. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | We are a bit behind on our group reports and presentations so will need to put more time in to ensure quality | Good so far. Work required on other traffic signs detection improvement. |
| **Planned Activities** | Complete group report and presentation | Refine the OpenCv code within the simulator. |
| **Achievements** | OpenCV has been successfully implemented into the simulator | N/A |
| **Major deliverables** | OpenCV code working in the simulator. | Refine prototype for client. |
| **Major issues** | Time constraints for our group report and presentation | Refining OpenCV detection code in simulator |
| **Major risks** | N/A | N/A |
