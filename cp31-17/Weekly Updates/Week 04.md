| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | Everyone |
| Report date| 14-20/09/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | No change  | N/A |
| Time | No change | N/A |
| Quality | Good | N/A |
| Planned activities | Improve more on the algorithm component in OpenCV, work on the remaining Unity signs, complete Unity documentations, update everyone's computer with Unity improvements, implement OpenCV to donkey | Finish unity signs, keep improving OpenCV detection, familiarize with DonkeyCar implementation algorithm, figure out the bug associated with DLL Load error for donkey OpenCV implementation |
| Achievements | Created tests for sign detection algorithm. Autopilot up and running for the team. Exploring current sign detection literature, experimented with houghlines/circles and feature matching (ORB, SIFT descriptors) | N/A |
| Major deliverables | Added working traffic light into simulator. Bitbucket has been updated with documentation for sign and map implementation. | Complete remaining signs and model two cars provided by client. Research better solutions with OpenCV.|
| Major issues | Problems implementing OpenCV to Donkeycar | OpenCv implementation |
| Major risks | N/A | N/A |
| External dependencies |  N/A| N/A |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 Group + 8 Individual  | 4 Group + 8 Individual |
