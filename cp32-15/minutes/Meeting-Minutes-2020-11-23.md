Notes:

* More of a "showcase" than a code demo
* Pre-recorded demo videos are allowed/encouraged.
    * There should be no silence during the videos. While the videos are playing, feel free to explain the technical details.
* Uninteresting points:
    * How to install DonkeyCar
    * Training of neural net driver
* Interesting points:
    * Non-technical aspects on how we got the NN to work for sign detection
        * High-level - used Tensorflow
        * Low-level - "We took an entire frame from the simulator, then drew bounding boxes on the frames and then train the model..."
* Testing:
    * Talk about results, rather than how we got them.
    * Skim over the testing - Jump straight to "These are the results we got"
* Technical deployment:
    * Cian to have a meeting tomorrow to organise the deployment of the team's entire setup on an Ubuntu machine.
