## Work Done

The general way in which our group completed and assigned tasks was in a 2 team
procedure.

In the beginning I was a part of the simulator team and provided assistance in the early
configuration of the donkey-gym platform.

After initial configuration was completed I moved over to assist with the algorithm and
computer vision team where I worked predominantly on the Park sign detection code as
well as some work done on improving the Traffic light detection algorithm. Evidence:

Additionally, I implemented the RMRacer library into our current code base which then
allowed us to test our code in the simulation environment.

The above pertains to the technical contributions towards the project and the following
details the roles and responsibilities within the group processes such as XP roles. All
members of the team took on the role of developer, doomsayer and tester. My
responsibility was predominantly as the client liaison in which I was the major
communication point between our client; Cian Byrne and the rest of our team - this
involved communicating changes in scope and general requirements as well as
expectations from the project.


Evidence of weekly planning can be found in our teams wiki weekly updates:

### Quality of work done

Across the entire team a large amount of pair or group programming was performed when
it was deemed necessary. Due to the nature of this project it involves a large amount of
minor tweaks to algorithms so therefore the quality for the most part has been assured
through other means.

We followed proper coding practices and testing frequently with a large amount of
coverage as well ensuring we handle corner and edge cases appropriately. Additionally,
code review is a major part of our group processes in which during our weekly meeting we
will review the code that was completed or changed throughout the week and address any
potential issues.

Code refactoring was done by me when moving our code to be integrated with the
simulator (took many commits but this is the last one where the version was finalised and
stable):

## Reflection

Version control within this project has been fairly easy to manage as a number of the
members are quite experienced with git and thus we haven't had issues working on our
own branches and submitting pull requests upon the successful completion of the work.

The coding style had very little variety throughout this initial part of the project. Due to the
nature of the project it was simply a case of developing test cases and fiddling with the
intricate details of the masks and filters in order to improve the success of sign detection.
The only time this changed was when we implemented various libraries or integrating the
simulation into our testing environment. This was simply a case of doing paired work as
well weekly reviews with the team so that members on different teams had a great
understanding of the project holistically.

The way in which we have integrated XP as a framework has worked well with all members
rotating roles in the initial weeks. The delegation of these role rotations can be found in our
group contract:

The only role we did not rotate was Client liaison which i was given charge of. This involved
all the original correspondence with our client (Cian Byrne) as well the organisation of
client meetings throughout the project lifecycle and finally clarification of the scope
requirements and overall project expectations.

In addition to this role I took on the role of Manager during Week 2; which involved me
scheduling meetings and taking agenda items and meeting minutes. Furthermore, the
primary responsibility I had was developing a set of goals we needed to achieve in a given
week and hand this over to the tracker for the week.


In addition to these 2 major roles i as well as the rest of the team take on the
responsibilities of programmer, tester and doomsayer. All members contribute to the
development of the project from a software point of view; the kind of contribution purely
dependent on whether the member is a part of the OpenCV team or Unity Simulator team.
Every member similarly is responsible for testing the code rigorously such that there is
always a fully functioning piece of software and all members are expected to highlight
upcoming deadlines (almost like a tracker but less involved).

Most of our planning for the future has come from the meeting minutes and weekly
updates, however after the submission of this report; over the mid semester break we will
be implementing a new group contract where we will go over changes that need to be made
for group processes.

## Writing and Wiki

All members were involved in the writing of the various wiki pages on the Bitbucket. No
one person was responsible for meeting minutes or weekly updates as we alternated.
