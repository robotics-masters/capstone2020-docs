We went over the steps necessary to converting sign detection code into a format that the simulator can use, including what needs to be imported, and what files need to be edited : in particular, most of the class variables needed to be changed, and parts of the detection code that determine the frame and hsv values are not needed due to it being provided in one form or another via parameters in the signs.py file which would include the detection code.
