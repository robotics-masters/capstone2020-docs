| **Time** | Should be good. | Should be good. |
| **Quality** | Overall quality of the project and its deliverables | |
| **Planned Activities** | Refine the OpenCv code and implement models in the simulator. Train an AI model, implement donkey parts into the simulator, improve lighting in the simulator.| Have every member train their own version of the AI, implement new models into the simulator, modelling new cars into the simulator, added documentation. |
| **Achievements** | New models implemented. Coding was written for the state-changing traffic lights. Implementation of donkey parts and improvements to lighting. Working AI model.| Finished models, modified OpenCV and training data from all members |
| **Major deliverables** | Donkey parts have been added to the project, improvements to the OpenCv code and new models have been put in.| Improvements to the simulator and to the OpenCv code using client feedback ((Object-detecting shapes, and edge detecting)) |
| **Major issues** | Everyone needs some experience with the OpenCv code by the end of week 5. |N/A|
