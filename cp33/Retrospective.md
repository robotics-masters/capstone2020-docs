**Retrospective**

Scope: Our assessments - group report, video, client demo

| **What went well** | **Areas to improve** | **Actions required** | **What was difficult** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Team communication whilst making the report - used Messenger and Discord to collaborate on group project and video | Client demo - wasn&#39;t well structured and we need to plan it out more next time, also need to involve everyone as well as have a test run before | We should communicate more about the technical parts of our project - we should hold sessions where each member discusses what they&#39;re working on | Technical problems for video - we couldn&#39;t get a continuous recording for the video on Zoom so we had to splice recordings |
| Planning on the report - we effectively assigned sections for each member and delegated work to everyone | Documentation - for our group report, the documentation wasn&#39;t too technical - we should include more technical sections | Include more technical sections to our documentation/report | Trying to express the technical aspects of the project in documentation as there isn&#39;t much code |
| We have communicated effectively within our group | Overall throughout the project, we have relied a bit too much on Facebook Messenger for communication between group which made documentation/evidence of communication in reports a bit difficult | We need to focus more on communicating via Slack and Discord | Integration of all the various components |
| The presentation went well in general according to the client. | Presentation structure - Did not show who was talking (?) | Have video on next time | Did not know this was a requirement, previous meetings have been fine with cameras off. |
| We have a way to test the neural net and calculate accuracy. | We didn&#39;t do too much with git - we need to use it more often to show collaboration as well as use PRs | We should communicate with the client more often on Discord with any problems or requirements | It&#39;s hard to automate the testing of things like the simulator and drone flight. Right now we can only test by running it manually and visually inspecting. |
| We have separate git branches for different functionality and this has worked fine so far. | We don&#39;t have a way yet to test everything else. | Testing - we need to come up with a testing framework | Some of the git errors were a bit hard to fix. |
| We listed each dotpoint of the specs in the slideshow and stated clearly which one were completed and which ones were pending. | Had some issues with merging branches before the demo. | Use git more - set up standards for we should use git in this project | Some of our requirements are a bit tricky to translate into user stories. |
| In the report, we clearly listed all of the user stories, indicating which we had completed and which still needed to be worked on. | We could have done the same with user stories - perhaps also adding user stories to the slide show and using the same format. | Consider adding user stories to next deployment demo, also improving the format of users stories. |
 |
|
 | User stories formatting in the report and presentation was not up to standard, and we were also unclear in the presentation about which user stories still needed to be completed. | Make sure that we format user stories in the appropriate way, and that we are always clear about what work we have done and what work we still need to do. |
