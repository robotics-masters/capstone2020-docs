| Unit of Study | COMP3888 |
|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | Julian |
| Report date| 01/11/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | Traffic light implementation and second car model may not be able to be done.  | N/A |
| Time | Project scheduled to finish on time. | N/A |
| Quality | Improved method of testing using tub data as well as better creation tools for the map track. Arrow turn detection has improved. | N/A |
| Planned activities | Work on F1 maps. Implement accuracy testing. Improve circle turn detection. Simulate more realistic traffic light bloom. | Clean Bitbucket repository. Finalise Hockenheim F1 map. Work on group report.  |
| Achievements | Implemented better testing methods that include all signs. Improved track generation asset. Ported all team members to Donkeycar 4.0.  | N/A |
| Major deliverables | None. | Final report. Demo of testing methods used.|
| Major issues | Bitbucket repo size exceeding limit. Bloom not working in simulator, preventing traffic light detection from functioning with current algorithm.  | Expected issues and issues to monitor |
| Major risks | Time management problems with client resolved as client mistook deadline for a week earlier. | Potential loss of data when deleting excess files from repository. |
| External dependencies |  Assignments due for some of team. Work commitments prevents some members from attending meetings.| Work commitments prevents some members from attending meetings. Other university course commitments can prevent members from reaching required volume of work|
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual | 4 group + 8 individual |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 4 group + 9 individual | N/A |
| Overall Status (Red/Yellow/Green)| Yellow | N/A |
