**Project Name:**  **CP31 - Implement Sign Detection using only Computer Vision**

**Project Period:**  **24 August 2020 - 29 November 2020**

**Sponsor(s) or Client:**  **Cian Byrne**

**Organisation: Robotics Mas**** ter**

**Project Supervisor:**  **Cian Byrne**

| **Background: ** _The context for this project_   | Lookat existing techniques and create new software solutions to detect a number of predefined traffic signs using only computer vision. Team will look at different technologies and come up with a solution that is reliable and efficient. |
| --- | --- |
| **Aim** _Purpose of the project._ | To create new software solutions to detect a number of predefined traffic signs using only Computer Vision. This solution may incorporate a range of different technologies, and must be reliable and efficient.Improvements to the simulator should also be made to help achieve this. |
| **Objectives (SMART):  **_Goals of the project._ | Create an algorithm that can accurately and reliably detect different traffic signs using Computer Vision. We want to achieve a high level of accuracy with our algorithm.
Attend the Virtual Racing League and Venture Cafe sessions 1+, and 2+ times respectively.
Make the simulator easier to use and understand.
 |
| **Success Criteria: ** _What does success look like for the sponsor and how can it be  __measured?__  _ | Meeting the deliverables given by the client in a timely manner. |
| **Deliverables** _List the outputs that will be produced as part of the project including the final product or service._ | OpenCV algorithm for detecting different traffic signs.Different assets modelling traffic signs.Different tracks for the car, modelled in Unity.All code in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.Documentation. |
| **Scope** _The work that needs to be accomplished in order to deliver/complete the project._ | Milestone 1 (Wk 3) :Add track layouts and models outlined in email.Milestone 2 (Wk 9):Create a better way to add track layouts and objects. Add 2+ new layouts.Milestone 3 (Wk 6): Improve existing code solutions.Document the research into improvements, with results.Demo with data and simulation (in different environments).Add extra objects for detection.Milestone 4 (Wk 9):All outlined signs detectable, with corresponding action response.Another demo with sample data and in simulator (with different environments).Milestone 5 (Wk 12):Usage documentation as per each milestone.Demo of working solution on simulated track.Deliverables (documentation, Jupyter notebooks, and the final Python library) must be completed. |
| **Out Scope** _Work you are not required to deliver as part of your project_ | Line following and lane detection, with response from object actions.Different coloured lanes based on environmentWay for a vehicle to follow a path that is not necessarily a lane.New DonkeyCar from RoboStore modelled in simulator.Implementing speed sign detection.Including multiple cars in the simulatorImplementing Albert Park race track. |
| **Milestones** _Key checkpoints with the client e.g. client deployment, approval deadlines_ | Milestone 1 – Simulator Additions (Week 3)Milestone 2 – Simulator Enhancements (Week 9)Milestone 3 – Computer Vision minor sign detection (Week 6)Milestone 4 – Computer Vision major detection (Week 9)Milestone 5 – Completed Solution with Demo and Documentation (Week 12) |
| **Human Resources: **  _Are there other specialist staff or subject matter experts that will participate?_  | _None._ |
| **Other Resources:  ** _Are there other resources to be utilized in the project? Data? Equipment?_  | - An assortment of ways to communicate about and organise this project : Messenger, Discord, Slack, Bitbucket. |
| **Reporting/ Meeting Frequency: ** _With what regularity will the team meet with the client_ _and report to the client._ | 2 Client meetings weekly.1 Team meeting weekly. |
