Keenan:

- Created a range of tests to measure the accuracy of our OpenCv algorithms. Did this in the form of measuring true positives, false positives, etc... on captured data. This addresses user story no. 4.

- Collected data to be used in our tests, and labeled them so that we know if we should be expecting a detection or not when we apply our OpenCv algorithms. This addresses user story no. 4.

Oscar: 

- Implemented P character checking. (this addresses user story 5)

- began testing of this via edited images that have or do not have P in the sign. (this addresses user story 4)

Osama:

- Worked on implementing the traffic light detection code in the simulator but was requested to work on the real-world footage only by the client. For the real-world footage, I have tried using sliding window approach which was computationally expensive so instead trying out an ROI-based approach which uses color segmentation to extract important parts of an image. [[User story #3]](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/User%20stories) 

- Discussed and reviewed Keenan's work on the testing framework and suggested improvements he could make. [[User story #4]](https://bitbucket.org/Osamaaa/comp3888_t13a_group5/wiki/User%20stories)

Chengdong Fu

- add yellow park code in simulator

- add two more ratio check for letter 'P' in green park code

Tamara:

- Created code for black arrow, improved code for black and blue arrow, detecting direction, used SIFT using image of sign texture

- Edited unity tracks to be able to record testing data for my code
