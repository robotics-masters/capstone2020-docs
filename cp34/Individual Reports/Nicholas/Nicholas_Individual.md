# Individual Report
# XP role 

I have been given a permanent XP role of the Customer for this project to help improve the project’s efficiency and overall chances of success. In addition to this, I also maintained the roles of Manager and Tracker as I will elaborate down below in the ‘Challenges’ section; as there are times whereby group members are not able to attend the virtual meetings. 

In the past weeks, undertaking the role of the Customer, I have communicated with the client constantly through the platform of email, discord and slack, to raise up problems we have faced throughout the project and kept updated with the progress of the project. For this role I have ensured everyone in the project is well informed about the progress of the project and any outstanding issues that must be addressed.

I have acted as a role of the Manager to help set up the communication platform between all the parties involved in the project. This involved making sure that we are able to schedule dates and times for the team to meet up with the client. Ensure each meeting will be recorded and well documented for future reporting.

Furthermore, I also acted in the role of the Tracker for the duration of the project, whereby from time to time I will check on the team member with their progress of their given tasks, to ensure that each member will be able to deliver their task on time, and if there are any problems faced pertaining to their assigned tasks, I am able to raise it to the client and act accordingly with what the project objectives were.


# Contribution 

The nature of this project was software orientated and not necessarily involved with the hardware aspect of it. The objective of this project was divided into two parts: firstly, it was to program a simulation system that reflected real-world conditions for drone operational testing. And secondly, to produce an algorithm that optimizes drone delivery pathways and mechanisms. I am working mainly on the simulation system Gazebo and the flight control software, ArduPilot and PX4.


# Technical 

1. World rendering and object creating
*   Deciding the fixed world to work on the project with a big enough environment to apply the algorithm and simulate the real world.
*   Extracting the drone code out, for future usage when we have to deploy multiple drones.
*   Created charging station object.
*   Research on the spawning of objects in the simulated world, for generating a population of charging stations in the world.

    Plans for future weeks, being able to insert more conditions towards the simulated world like delivery checkpoints object and insert more drones.

2. Drone related
*   Did a test run on the drone with different altitude to find out the battery usage of the drone.

    Plans in future weeks, is to implement battery safeguard, object detection plugins to the drone. This will help the 


# Non-technical 

The roles played in organizing client and team meetings to aid team members in actively participating as much as possible throughout the duration of this project. Also, I made contributions to weekly status reports and minute meetings and ensured everyone was up to date on all sub-project progresses. 

Furthermore, I remained active on the platform used to communicate, to make sure both the client and the group are able to reach me and each other, that is; to maintain a proper record of communications for better documentation of what has been discussed. 

The hope is that in future weeks for this project, I can better exercise my role to help reduce miscommunication among the team and the client’s instructions and project objectives.

# Reflection 


# Extreme Programming 

With the role I have been assigned to, I have to be more proactive and communicate more with the Manager, Tracker and client. As the role Customer, I have to work closely with them, to ensure the team is able to keep with up the tasks’ deadlines and the expectations of the client. 


# Challenges 

*   Initially, the issue of compatibility was incurred whereby there were technical difficulties installing and connecting the simulator, Gazebo and the flight control software, ArduPilot and PX4. This was presented as being a critical problem due to incompatibility with the operating system of Windows OS and required a specific version of the Linux OS, Ubuntu 18.04. Thus, there was a lack of operating effectively due to the constraint of being unable to work on the simulating software as the main platform due such tasks were rendered pointless. Hence, it was only through multiple trial and error efforts was I able to ascertain the correct version of the OS to use, and then work on my assigned tasks for this project. 
*   Moreover, the other issue that had occurred were the limited resources available pertaining to this specific topic and project despite there being an online community. With such knowledge deficits, it became somewhat onerous to place together an accurate depiction of what was needed to be done. As although, there was much emphasis placed in their internal processes on hardware, and so, with less research and development involving the software input; I had less information available to account and reflect upon in order to produce the required software and the appropriate testing for such software.
*   Furthermore, communication amongst the team members was perhaps the most prevalent issue that was encountered. This had affected my team and I’s cohesion process in addition to affecting our efficiency in completing our assigned tasks. This needed to be considered as such assignments were all correlated and attached to each other, and inadequate levels of correspondence with each other lead to somewhat last-minute details or the inability to fully operate efficiently and increased delays. Hence, it was a personal challenge to manage team communications and enable us to converse on a regular basis for the duration of this project. 


# Role in Software Development 

*   Due to lack of accessible documentation regarding this specific simulator software, it was then required of me to research and learn the SDFormat in order to manipulate generated objects. This allowed me to place simulated structures at different positions and orientations; which was critical for flight testing as it enabled my team and I to reflect real-world conditions. 
*   In addition to this, the technique of pair programming was implemented which proved to be insightful and useful despite being unsuccessful in the compatibility of the world simulation to the flight software that my team and I were working on, since two different flight control software as ArduPilot and PX4 operate differently. However, success in installation of these project aspects were obtained via a different method aside from pair programming. Especially, given the pandemic conditions whereby physical meetings were not feasible.  


# Future Improvements 

When I am working with both the simulator and the flight controller software, I have to document the method and the issues occurred while running them. By doing so, it will tell the client how to respond to the issues when running the software and help developer to understand my decision making in different situations in this project.
