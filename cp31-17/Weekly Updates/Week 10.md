# Week 10 Weekly Update
| Unit of Study | COMP3888 |
|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person | Julian |
| Report date| 08/11/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | Second DonkeyCar model no longer needs to be modelled. Traffic light detection and response no longer needs to be done | N/A |
| Time | None | N/A |
| Quality | Testing methods for project has been greatly expanded with real world data now included. F1 Hockenheim track is up to standard.  | N/A |
| Planned activities | Project report and presentation. Finish off Monaco track. Finalise sign detection and response and merge branches.  | Final presentation and demo. |
| Achievements | Managed to get training data tub conversion to DonkeyCar 4.0 working. F1 Hockenheim has been completed. Framework for all responses. | N/A |
| Major deliverables | F1 Hockenheim track | Report and presentation/demo video.|
| Major issues | Git repository successfully cleaned by contacting Bitbucket staff. | Merging simulator files may cause some problems.|
| Major risks | Not being able to complete the second DonkeyCar model has been addressed with client as he could not produce the required images for us needed to model. | Potential for members to ignore report and keep working on detection code. |
| External dependencies |  Client could not provide second DonkeyCar model, thus removing it as a requirement from our scope.| Work and assignment commitments prevents some members from being available during regular meeting hours. |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual  | 4 group + 8 individual |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 4 group + 7 individual | N/A |
| Overall Status (Red/Yellow/Green)|Green | N/A |
