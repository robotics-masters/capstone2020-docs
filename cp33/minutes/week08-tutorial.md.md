Feedback from Frank on mid-semester assessments:

* Presentation:
    - Lack of cohesion between front-end and back-end parts of presentation
    - Intro section was good
    - Should have cameras one to make it clear who is speaking
    - User stories format needs to be improved, and it needs to be made clear both what we have done and what still remains to be done
    - Need to be more on the ball for Q&A
* Group report:
    - Need to elaborate on tests -- say why we chose certain tests, provide specifics on our testing processes rather than just an overview
    - Reflection section needs to be expanded
    - Need more specifics on technical stuff
    - Need more evidence/explanation of XP principles, e.g. pair programming
    - Tools section was good but felt a bit like padding
    - Need more elaboration in general -- Frank expecting more *depth* from advanced students

Other issues:

* The repo has become full, largely due to too much data and variable files from TensorFlow
    - Fixed to some extent using large file storage
    - Need to make sure we git ignore large binary/variable files
