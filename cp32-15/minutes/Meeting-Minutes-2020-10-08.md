    * Online
    * Virtual "cafe" - members from the public can attend and ask us questions
    * 2-3 people should attend (virtual tables have 6 seats, so if all team attends, no room for visitors from the public)

* Sprint tasks in the future
    * We are free to set out own sprint goals now - client is less directive with weekly goals

* GPU Server
    * From tomorrow (hopefully) the redering server will have 4 GPUs so we can use this to train models
