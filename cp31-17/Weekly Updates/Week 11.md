| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | Final client deployment moved to Thursday 26th of November. | N/A |
| Time | Project expected to finish on time. | N/A |
| Quality | Sign response needs autopilot to be tested but detection is up to standard. F1 Monaco still needs polish with terrain. | N/A |
| Planned activities | Final presentation and demo. Complete Monaco.  | Final presentation and demo, report work. Complete Monaco. |
| Achievements | Autopilot has been trained with Donkey 4.0. Final presentation and demo is in progress.  | N/A |
| Major deliverables | None | Final presentation and demo. Final group report.|
| Major issues | Autopilot is now functional and can be used to test sign response. |Bugs with the autopilot for Windows users. |
| Major risks | Members have been focusing on presentation/demo as directed. Sign detection work has been finalised.| Inability to showcase sign response for demo if we don't get it working with autopilot. |
| External dependencies |  Work and assignment commitments prevents some members from being available during regular meeting hours.| Same as last week. |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual  | 4 group + 7 individual |
