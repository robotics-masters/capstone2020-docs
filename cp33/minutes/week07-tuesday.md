* Client demo to occur this Friday -- 3 main components:
    1. 2-4 slide powerpoint
        - What we have completed so far
        - What still needs to be completed by the end of semester
        - Any other interesting things, e.g. how we overcame simulator issues
    2. Live demo
        - Detection code running in simulator
        - Show live testing of code
    3. Client deployment
        - Need Cian to be able to run everything on his machine
        - Make sure wiki has clear instructions
* NN currently not working well due to too much background noise
* Perhaps we won't use OpenCV
* Much more data needed:
    - Get more images from Gazebo
    - Flip existing images
    - Use external datasets (e.g. German signs)
* Need images of signs both with and without busy background
