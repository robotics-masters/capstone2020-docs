# Extreme Programming (XP) Notes

This is a page for everyone to add their notes and finding regarding the XP paradigm.

## 12 Core Rules

1. **Planning Game** (see later)
2. **Small Releases** - release features early and often
3. **System Metaphor** - project has a metaphor as its naming convention
4. **Simple Design** - by Occam's razor, choose the simpler of two solutions
5. **Continuous Testing** - tests written before feature, including unit and acceptance tests
6. **Refactoring** - refactor (remove) duplicate code with confidence
7. **Pair Programming** - all production code written in pairs at one machine
8. **Collective Code Ownership** - no code is precious, anyone can edit anything
9. **Continuous Integration** - push code daily
10. **40-Hour Work Week** - have a work life balance
11. **On-Site Customer** - continuous access to customer
12. **Coding Standards** - team adheres to agree upon coding guidelines and standards

## Planning Game
Dev team and customer must cooperate to come up with a project plan:

1. Establish list of desired features with customer.
2. Write each feature as a User Story, with a name and description.
3. Estimate the effort for each User Story, and teams effort/time rate (work per week).
4. With customer, decide on order of stories and milestone or release time period.
