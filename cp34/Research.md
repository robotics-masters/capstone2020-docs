| Title | What was taken away | How was this helpful | Link (Date Used) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| PX4 GitHub Repository | Used to guide our installation of Gazebo9 and PX4.  | This link was essential to installing the environment  | [08/09/2020](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo) |
| SITL  | We learnt about the system architecture and what SITL (Softwre-in-the-loop) meant.  | It allowed us to understand how each component (the flight stack, flight control software, ground control software, MAVLink) all worked together. | [12/09/2020](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html) |
| PX4: Basic Concepts | **This is a highly recommended link to read when getting started.** We learnt about each of the concepts in modern drone flight. | Building upon the above table entry, we were able to put everything together mentally and understand the depth of the project. | [13/09/2020](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html) |
| PX4 Development Guide | We learnt how to install toolchains for Windows (this was before we had decided to all dual-boot Ubuntu 18.04) and Linux in order to start developing for PX4 | We had a base reference for all things development in terms of PX4 | [15/09/2020](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/) |
| Installing ArduPilot | The documentation allowed us to install ArduPilot again from scratch as we planned to use both flight stacks (ArduPilot and PX4). | This let us realise that ArduPilot and PX4 were copmletely different in how they operated which meant we needed to discuss this with our client. | [15/09/2020](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html) [15/09/2020](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-linux.html#building-setup-linux) [16/09/2020](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl.html#using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl) [16/09/2020](https://github.com/swiftgust/ardupilot_gazebo)|
| MAVLink Basics  | Learnt the basic use of MAVLink and gained an enhanced insight as to how we were supposed to utilise it's functions  | We were able to udnerstand how MAVLink interacted within the architecture of the system.  | [21/09/2020](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/mavlink-basics.html) |
| WSL-Gazebo-ROS Issue  | After trying use SITL Gazebo Simulation on WSL and getting the GUI from an xserver, there were a lot of bugs, a comment in this thread gave way to the idea of headless Gazebo instances  | This meant we could try to use docker to run Gazebo on windows (again, this is before we all migrated to Ubuntu 18.04) | [24/09/2020](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13546) |
| Protobuf Incompatibility with Python3  | Whilst creating the installation script, we learnt that we needed to upgrade this library in order for Gazebo to run out of the box on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04.  | It allowed the creation of a successful installation script which can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/DylDupe/comp3888_t15a_group1/src/master/install.sh).  | [13/10/2020](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/7) |
| Spawning Multiple Drones - GitHub Issue | Nothing technical was learnt from this page. | It displayed the fact that others were originally having this issue but that their issues were likely because of the Ubuntu version they were using. This pointed us in a more clear direction, we had to look for Ubuntu 18.04 specific Gazebo documentation.  | [01/11/2020](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11458) |
| ROS - roslaunch tutorial | How to use and create ".launch" files. | Helped us to understand (and eventually implement) spawning multiple drones and opening worlds that aren't the empty world by default. | [04/11/2020](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_roslaunch) |
| PX4: Obstacle Avoidance | We learnt of the existance of avoidance software "local planner" | We began to look for "local planner" documentation  | [04/11/2020](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/computer_vision/obstacle_avoidance.html) |
| PX4: Avoidance - Getting Started | We learnt to install avoidance software ROS Melodic, local planner, and global planner (avoidance softwares) | Began to experiment with obstacle avoidance with local planner in conjunction with QGroundControl | [04/11/2020](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance#getting-started) |
| Gazebo: Building a world | The tutorial shows us how to build, save and load a simple world in Gazebo and simple manipulations of world | [Here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_world) |
| Gazebo: Make a model | The tutorial provided an overview of how models are being made in the simulator using SDF files | [Here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_model) |
| SDFormat | This site describes the SDF files in details to help our team to further understand how the we will be able to change the element and attribute of the model in the simulator | [Here](http://sdformat.org/spec) |
| Gazebo: Color And Texture Models | This tutorial illustrate how colour works in Gazebo, to help us change the colour of the model and objects in Gazebo | [Here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=color_model) |
| Gazebo: Population of models | This tutorial helps us understand how to create an object population that works closely with our Spawner function| [Here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=model_population&cat=build_world) |
