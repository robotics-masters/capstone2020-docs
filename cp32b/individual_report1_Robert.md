# Week 1 and 2 #
* I am the creator of our slack group.  
Slack is used for group communication, we can use multiple channels to chat over different topics regarding the project. I created this slack for our group, evidence:  
![image.M8CQR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2521792538-image.M8CQR0.png)
* I am the creator of our bitbucket repository.  
Bitbucket is used for maintaining the project code base and documentations with version control features, therefore I created our bitbucket repository for everyone to push their code. Evidence:
![image.W5P4R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1127736020-image.W5P4R0.png)
* I wrote the status report for this week. 
I was the tracker for week 2, that means my job is to write the weekly status report, which tracks our team progress of that week.  
Evidence:

We also have this recorded on wiki:
https://yuanda-dong.atlassian.net/browse/CP-8

* I researched articles about UML diagrams.  
This is the article that I looked at:  
https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/types-of-UML-diagrams

Conclusion: There are different types of UML diagrams for different uses, but I believe the class diagram is the one we are looking for in this project since the client said he wants us to produce a UML diagram with different classes representing different components of the bioreactor system.  

* I contributed to our group contract  
We need a group contract to decide what our roles are from week 2 to week 4, as well as a summary of everyone’s capability regarding development. Evidence:
![image.K3NSR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/450490513-image.K3NSR0.png)
![image.IUE3R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2328479692-image.IUE3R0.png)
* I collaborated with the group  
I collaborated with the group via slack communications, about basic setups and meetings. Evidence:
![image.5MD6R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1439867853-image.5MD6R0.png)
* I contributed to the scope statement  
The scope statement defines what the project scope, objectives, and deliverables are, which is critical in extreme programming. I provided some help on how to write a SMART objective to group members. Evidence:
![image.UNL5R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/191510025-image.UNL5R0.png)
![image.G6GYR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1802262385-image.G6GYR0.png)
* I added our supervisor to our bitbucket repo  
The supervisor needs to be in the repository to monitor what we have done in coding and documenting, evidence:
![image.A7JQR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1381135673-image.A7JQR0.png)
* I raised an issue about jira’s charge for the amount of members  
Jira charges for a group more than 5 people, so I raised this issue to the group and suggested using trello, evidence:
![image.PCLSR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3452840702-image.PCLSR0.png)

My contribution for week 2 is mainly on the group process, since the project has just started and it is mainly about abstract UML design, which means there’s no concrete coding to do. Our team at this point has done pretty well since we did anything our supervisor and client wanted us to achieve.  



# Week 3 #
* I provided my list of skills for changing the project  
We decided to change the project due to the last one being too abstract for us. I updated my list of skills for our customer to email to the unit coordinator, evidence:
![image.61YRR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1251006557-image.61YRR0.png)
* I suggested everyone to use the “meeting” channel
We should use the meeting channel to discuss and record anything meeting related so that we won’t find it hard to find some particular meeting minutes, evidence:
![image.Z24ZR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3691483301-image.Z24ZR0.png)
* I updated the wiki page for my individual report
We hold individual progress updates on our individual page, so that it is easier for the client and supervisor to review what we have done, evidence:
![image.L58KR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/265353508-image.L58KR0.png)
* I set up my donkeycar and tensorflow environment on my computer
This project requires us to use tensorflow to implement a sign detection algorithm for the donkeycar to train on a simulator, thus we need to set up the environment first, evidence:
![toolarge.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1000234732-toolarge.png)
* I took some notes for our first client meeting  
The first client meeting is crucial and contains a lot of information, therefore it is necessary that I take notes whilst listen to the client explain the project, evidence:
![image.XR94R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2921327113-image.XR94R0.png)
![image.4J2MR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2101044129-image.4J2MR0.png)
This week we switched our project to CP32, which is more concrete for us and we know what to do in the project. My work on week 3 mainly focuses on setting up the donkeycar environment along with tensorflow, which I had some trouble with the simulator setup, there is a bug that the simulator will automatically select a track but the user won’t be able to drive using keyboard, I solved this issue next week.  







# Week 4 #
* I updated my individual wiki page with what I’ve done this week  
We hold individual progress updates on our individual page, so that it is easier for the client and supervisor to review what we have done, evidence:
![image.GO9WR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1126513139-image.GO9WR0.png)

* I learned about tensorflow image classification  
I learned about tensorflow image classification and understood how to implement a stop sign classifier algorithm, from this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification, as well as from **Yiran’s code** here:
![image.2A5WR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2346905016-image.2A5WR0.png)
This can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/src/master/sign_detection_code/Robert/ImageClassification_TF/Classification_stop_sign_17Sep.py

* I trained the self-driving donkeycar model  
I trained the self-driving donkeycar model in the simulator using the dataset I recorded from driving around in it, this can be found in my demo video here:
https://youtu.be/mPnv8xmU_tg  

* I helped modify the scope statement for the new project  
We need to update our scope statement to the newest version, so I contributed to the “aim” part, evidence:
![image.TJXZR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1831515962-image.TJXZR0.png)
(This is a screenshot from a deleted document, our scope statement can be found on our wiki: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O95zkWlROHil834AT7utOUu-BORgkyP56akoBv55CMQ/edit.)

I recorded my weekly summary video
We are required to record an individual weekly summary video that summarises what we have done for each week, so that our client can know the progress from each of us. This can be found here: https://youtu.be/NiPeBPrbKXM

* I resolved a confusing bug from last week  
I simply commented the line (line 15) of code in myconfig.py that selects which track the donkeycar will use, so that the simulator won’t select track for me and I could see the “keyboard control” option when I select a track myself:  
![image.KVUPR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3189832211-image.KVUPR0.png)

This week, my work mainly focuses on getting myself familiar with the donkeycar driving and training, as well as how the tensorflow sign detection algorithm works. The bug I solved turns out next week to be not only on my machine but on Yuanda’s as well, we talked about it in private.  



# Week 5 #
* I updated my individual wiki page with what I’ve done this week  
We hold individual progress updates on our individual page, so that it is easier for the client and supervisor to review what we have done, evidence:  
![image.GZT1R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2185736240-image.GZT1R0.png)
* I made a local client - server donkeycar race  
I opened two simulators, one for server and one for client, the server does not change its config file but the client would have to, because the client needs to connect to a specific server (uncomment the server path line of code), in this case (local), it is simply “localhost”, myconfig.py for the client:
![image.ZFVMR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1786804096-image.ZFVMR0.png)
The web_control_port needs to be different from the server, because they are all running on localhost.  

* I made a LAN client - server donkeycar race  
I collaborated with Yuanda (He lives next to me) to build a local area network donkeycar race. Basically we still change the config file of the client car, this time with:  
![image.1BXTR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/4029154790-image.1BXTR0.png)
as the server’s private ip address in the same network. **Please note that this is just an example LAN ip!! This needs to be whichever ip address the terminal tells you when you type ifconfig (linux) and locate the “inet”.**  

* I tested the remote client - server donkeycar race with Cian  
I collaborated with Yuanda and Cian (our client) to build a wide area network donkeyar race. This time we need to configure our router setting first before changing the client's config file. We were confused with that so we asked the client on Discord and he clarified:  
![image.COO5R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2536517917-image.COO5R0.png)
![image.PAF2R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3011944076-image.PAF2R0.png)

    Basically we need to setup a port forwarding like this:  
![image.9EK3R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/571408854-image.9EK3R0.png)
The port 9091 is the default communication port between client and server configured internally by the developers of donkeycar.  

We voice called with Cian on Discord and it worked when Cian is the server and we can see the cars at his side through our web interface, here is a snapshot I took:  
![image.EPMWR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3775571266-image.EPMWR0.png)

But we failed on our side as the server, we guess the reason being our ISP blocked port forwarding requests from the Internet due to security reasons.  

* I also collaborated with Yiran and Nicole to test the remote server  
Yiran has no household router so we can’t really get this to work, but we voice chatted  on wechat and I explained some relative network concepts to her, evidence:  
![phonelarge.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/1210351396-phonelarge.png)

On the other hand, Nicole and I did not get this to work either, I guess it is probably the same reason (Her ISP also blocks the port forwarding requests from the Internet), here’s some chat history:  
![image.0Z9UR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2345135762-image.0Z9UR0.png)

* I wrote the meeting minutes for this week  
We reallocated and fixed our roles from week 5 onward, I am now the manager till the end of the project, therefore I wrote the meeting minutes to record what were discussed and what we were going to do next, the client meeting minutes can be found here:  
https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/wiki/MeetingMinutes_Week5_Client1  
And the group meeting one can be found here:  
https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/wiki/MeetingMinutes_Tut_Week5

* I asked some questions to the client on Discord  
The meeting with Cian on Friday was cancelled by him, therefore we asked some questions we had on Discord:  
![image.11MXR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/41646227-image.11MXR0.png)
![image.GXT4R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/116133918-image.GXT4R0.png)
![image.NVARR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/760633084-image.NVARR0.png)

My work on week 5 is not done perfectly because I did not make the remote server testing successful within our group, but I figured out the reason which is about the ISP blocking. During the team meeting, I suggested that I should take the role of manager forever because I am more familiar with the XP group process framework. Besides the work above, I also figured out a way to change lines on bitbucket markdown’s table editing and coached my teammate. Our supervisor was aware of that when we talked on Tuesday. My teammates can simply use my template when they are to write something on wiki. Here’s my weekly summary video for the work: https://youtu.be/d3iy-GJf6XI  


# Week 6 #
* I updated my individual wiki page with what I’ve done this week  
We hold individual progress updates on our individual page, so that it is easier for the client and supervisor to review what we have done, evidence:  
![image.9NMWR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/409033151-image.9NMWR0.png)
* I classified track images to different signs  
I classified about 31000 track images collected by other team members into four signs: stop, turn_right, turn_left and park, and “other” for non-signs or blurry ones. I did this manually because it was more efficient since our classifier still recognises the dragon on our new track as some sign, therefore it is quicker and more accurate to do this manually. Commit evidence:
![image.Z4D4R0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/2589841522-image.Z4D4R0.png)
Since our repository is too large, we decided to put all shared data on a drive, therefore my classified data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KkwxurRLc-Qs7yhW-hNDfAW4k0gvPRwb

* I contributed to the group report  
I contributed mainly on the quality of group process part in the group report (too much to include here with diagrams), the report can be found on our wiki: https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/wiki/COMP3988_T17B_Group1%20First%20Project%20Report as well as the canvas submission.  
I also drew the diagram of a backlog item (leaderboard) on the system specification part:
![image.GBJLR0.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/G6xBMXK/images/3618753032-image.GBJLR0.png)
I contributed to the demo video
I wrote the part of “quality of group process” in the slides, and I recorded my part of the demo video. The slides and video can be found on the canvas submission page of the demo.  

* I wrote the individual report  
Submission can be found on canvas and here: https://bitbucket.org/RobertJia/comp3988_t17b_group1/wiki/edit/individual_report1_Robert  

* I wrote the 360 degree team review report  
This can be found on my canvas submission page  

* I also wrote the meeting minutes for week 6
