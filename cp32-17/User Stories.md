The user stories would be as follows:

1) As a user, I would like to be able to drive around track1 and track2 in the simulator. If it is possible please ensure track 2 is 7.0 metres by 10.0 metres and track 1 is 15 metres by 9 metres in the simulator

2) As a user, I would like to be able to see signs such as stop signs inside the simulator and it has been of a certain size.

3) As a user, I would like to be able to see traffic lights inside the simulator.

4) As a user, I would like to be able to drive automatically around the circuit with AI

5) As a user, I would like to be able to have a system where the car (AI enabled) can detect traffic signs/ lights and do necessary action whenever it detects the sign/light.

6) As a user, I would like to have the documentation about how to add track and asset into the simulator.

7) As a user , I want to upload a list of images so that a video is created from it.

8) As a user , I want to download score for traffic light detection so that I can understand the accuracy of prediction.

9) As a user , I want to drive on imported tracks into the simulator accurately so that images captured would be precise and clear to be fed into image classification algorithm for sign detection using tensorflow.
