***As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.***

1. As a client, I want the computer vision model to improve the accuracy of detecting various types of turn signs so that the car can turn in the correct direction automatically.

2. As a client, I want the computer vision model to improve the accuracy of detecting various stop signs so the car can stop automatically.

3. As a client, I want the computer vision model to detect new traffic signs so the simulated car can imitate a real car.

4. As a developer, I want to write good testable code so that the results can be reproduced.

5. As a client, I want the computer vision model to differentiate between the given types of traffic signs such as turn left, turn right, stop, and parking, so that the different types of signs can result in different actions. 

6. As a client, I want the computer vision model to be able to determine the type of sign in vision under different levels of light so that the different models can still be understood when driving under different light conditions.  

7. As a client, I want a variety of tracks to be able to test the computer vision model on.

8. As a developer, I want the models to possess the right shapes and colors that the given signs possess so that the simulation has accurate stimuli for computer vision.

9. As a client, I want to have a variety of cars to use in the simulator

10. As a client, I want to be able to run the OpenCV detection code in the Donkey Car simulation.

11. As a client, I want the code to run on hardware that has limited computation power.

12. As a client, I want the computer vision model to work just as well in the simulator as it does in the real world.

13. As a developer, I want the codeâ€™s execution time to be similar across different hardwares.

14. As a client, I want a testing framework to measure the accuracy of the detection code.
