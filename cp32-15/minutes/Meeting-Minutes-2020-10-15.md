Notes:

* Demo:
	* Signs detecting within the simulator: right turn, stop and park. (left turn incorrectly identified as right sign)
	* Reactions to signs: successfully slowed down for stop sign, turned right for right sign
	* Dropping different signs in unity - success.
	* Testing: Will's model accuracy/precision results
	* Code walkthrough: SignReactor, ObjectDetector, resnet training
* Client deployment:
	* Client's personal system not yet configured to run the deployment, so will do this in a couple of weeks
* Feedback:
	* Documentation: 
		* We need *intrinsic* documentation (we already have this mostly) and function-level documentation.
* Recorded demo will be posted to youtube - link will be shared when available.
