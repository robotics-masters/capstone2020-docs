# First Project Report (Individual)

## Contributions:

All members took on the role of developer and tester. Also, all members of the group took turns
rotating the other XP roles. As such, at one point, I also took on the other roles. As a tracker, I
recorded the minutes and submitted the weekly reports.

## OpenCV:

This project had two different goals which are tied together eventually, so we decided to split the
milestones into two different teams.
In this project, I was assigned on the team to work on OpenCV sign detection, and I selected the
turn sign detection to work on mostly. Here I experimented with different transformations and
edge detection as well as minor refactors to the code in order to slightly improve the accuracy of
the given sign detection code. Evidence: https://bitbucket.org/comp3888-t17a/

I have also pair programmed with the other OpenCV-focussed group members and shared my
thoughts as to how to tackle the sign detection improvement task. In these cases, I explain to my
group members what ideas and transformations I have been experimenting with, and why I think
my approach can work, providing them with pictures of results from using certain ideas. I also
coded and exchanged ideas for improvements with Jordan.

Additionally I pair programmed with Winson to get testing working with rmracer + the new
simulator. We took turns being the driver and navigator. The work was done in a discord call
together with screen sharing used.

## Quality of work done

In order to ensure code quality, we followed many standard measures such as pair programming,
testing, as well as recording minutes.

## Reflection:


Our team uses Bitbucket for version control. The group has had no particular problems with
version control, since all members already have experience with Git. For the tasks, we split up into
2 teams, and have been working on different branches while testing each other’s and pulling
needed information. Our frequent team meetings also make it easier to explain commits to one
another and help teach others new changes and updates.

Coding style has been fine so far. Since the team has frequent meetings, and can work in pairs,
most members can easily understand the other’s code. Also, particularly in OpenCV, not all
changes are pushed since we are experimenting looking for improvements, and when
improvements are found, only small refactors are made or one or two lines of added
transformations are made.

The group has worked well rotating the XP roles each week. Aside from a few permanent roles,
our team easily passes on the tracker role each week. Also, we have had 2 client meetings a
week, with a small group meeting after to decide roles and tasks of the week, sort of like mini-
sprints.

Some of the challenges faced were meetings where some members are late, but we have shared
communication methods for friendly reminders (such as discord pings). For me personally, since I
live in the Eastern Standard Timezone, I have trouble attending all the meetings, or staying awake
and proactive in some meetings which are odd hours for me. However, the group has been very
helpful and understanding in scheduling group meetings or events more comfortable to my time,
as well as reminding me of certain upcoming meetings that may be at odd hours for me, or
updating me with meetings I may miss.

My role in the group so far has been just a standard developer since I have mostly been active
trying to improve the product. Moving forward I think I could try and take a more proactive
leadership role in the group, as well as make more merges to the main branch. I may be a bit too
conservative with pushing experiments onto Bitbucket since due to the nature of this project,
trying and working on new code may not translate to an improvement to the sign detection.

The team themselves have been great. All the members are self-motivated and communication is
solid. Members all usually have very quick response times, and are willing to free up time in order
to have extra meetings/linger on to do work after the client meetings etc...

## Writing and wiki use quality:

The wiki is a joint effort that we distribute through all members. Each member has substantially
contributed to making and adding to the wiki. The structure is very simple and the naming
schemes are organised making it easy for any member or client to add to or navigate the wiki.
