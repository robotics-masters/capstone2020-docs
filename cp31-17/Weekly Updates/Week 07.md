| Unit of Study | COMP3888 |
|--|--|
|Team name| Group 5 |
| Project name| CP31: Sign detection using OpenCV |
| Project start date| 3/9/20 |
| Project end date| Projected 20/11/20 |
| Project point person |Julian|
| Report date| 18/09/2020 |
| Quick Description | Using OpenCV to detect signs and take appropriate action inside of a driving simulator without the use of Artificial Intelligence|

|Status item | Status up to last week | Planned for next week|
|-|-|-|
| Scope | No changes  | N/A |
| Time | No changes | N/A |
| Quality | Sign detection is lacking behind in terms of detection success and actions. Simulator side is on pace.| Implement actions for signs. Refine until detection is decent. |
| Planned activities | Finish detection for remaining signs. Begin working on appropriate actions upon sign detection. Work on F1 track. Document implementing new car models and test cases. Upgrade in-sim camera resolution. | F1 track, remaining signs detection and action (turn, park and lights)|
| Achievements | First client deployment and demo. Updated simulator and made basic track of Nurburgring Circuit. Implemented brake. Poor working detection for remaining signs | N/A |
| Major deliverables | First client deployment and demo. | Final report drafting and Simulator documentation.|
| Major issues | Issues addressed last week | DonkeyCar 4.0.0 is still buggy and needs to be patched in order to get autopilot working again. |
| Major risks | Risks address/monitored last week | Quality of sign detection due to restrictive training environment |
| External dependencies | Exams and assignments due for some members.| None |
| Estimated effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual  | 4 group + 8 individual |
| Recorded effort (hours) | 4 group + 8 individual | N/A |
| Overall Status (Red/Yellow/Green)| Yellow | N/A |
